<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>I can conceive some readers, not necessarily frivolous, anticipating
little pleasure from a volume devoted to examples of Elizabethan and
Jacobean pamphlets. It must be the business of the volume I have
planned to convince them that they are wrong. But even before that
volume is read, I think it not impossible to show cause for its right
to exist. The originals of these pamphlets, except a few which have
become familiar in consequence of their bearing on Shakespearian
questions, were till recently almost unknown, except to a few scholars
and antiquaries, and are still for the most part inaccessible except
in the original editions, which are bought at large prices by
collectors, or in limited and often privately issued modern reprints.
Yet their interest is very great. The pamphlet of the late sixteenth
and early seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> century corresponded much more nearly to the
modern periodical than to anything else, unless, indeed, it be the
modern newspaper. It included fiction, sketches of society, accounts
of travel, literary criticism, personal controversy, theology,&mdash;the
whole farrago, in short, of the non-political columns of our journals.
It was in many cases written by men of much greater talent than the
average journalist of the present day. In one remarkable case&mdash;that
of the so-called Martin Marprelate controversy&mdash;it holds a position
almost unique, or only shared by the not wholly dissimilar groups of
literature which included and grew up round Pascal's <i>Provinciales</i>
and the <i>Tracts for the Times</i>. Above all, it has the advantage of
a singular variety of subject, and of presenting the opportunity of
making a great number of lively extracts, certainly faithful to the
manners of the time, and showing those manners in a fashion not easy to
surpass in freshness, contrast of colour, and incisive outline.</p>

<p>The pamphlet was one of the most immediate and necessary creations
of the printing press. Before that invention it was hardly possible,
and a very considerable time had to elapse afterwards before the
combination of education in the reader, command of mechanical means in
the diffuser, and changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> political conditions, enabled the newspaper
to supplant it. The pamphlet, so far as production is concerned, when
once private presses are accessible, gives few hostages to fortune or
to the strong hand of authority. It may make but a single appearance,
and then the type is broken up, the machinery removed, and the printed
copies left to find their way and do their work. A newspaper must have
more or less of a headquarters, definite managers, at the very least
a regular place and time of appearance at which it can be waited for
and snapped up. Of the advantages offered by the pamphlet there is a
good example in the fact that under the active, intelligent, and almost
despotic government of Elizabeth, though the Martin Marprelate tracts
excited the intensest hatred not merely of the lay authorities but of
a powerful and omnipresent ecclesiastical corporation, the presses
were only once (at Newton Lane in Lancashire) discovered and seized.
In less perilous matter the pamphlet, if it did not give so much
protection, 'obliged' even less. Its cost was small; the author was
in no way bound to follow it up with anything else. It took him but a
little time to produce; its profit, if there was any, came in quickly;
it could be sold out before pirates could get hold of it; it did not
frighten the unlearned by bulk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> pretensions. On the other hand, of
course, it had its drawbacks. It was of its nature, and in more points
than one of that nature, ephemeral. The chances were rather against
than in favour of its being preserved; for even in these days when
most people have a library or book-room of some kind, the very student
himself acknowledges with gnashings of teeth the way things published
in pamphlet form have of 'going under,' of simply disappearing, he
cannot tell how or whither. Hence the real and intrinsic interest
of the pamphlet has had added to it the accidental and factitious
interest of rarity. It is hardly a paradox to say that one of the best
chances which such a thing had of surviving was the fact of its being
proscribed and burnt by the hangman. There was then some reason for
treasuring it instead of letting it go to clean boots, light fires, and
wrap pounds of butter.</p>

<p>The pamphlets of the Elizabethan age were almost as often in verse as
in prose, the superior attraction of verse for early and uncultivated
audiences not having died out. Indeed, far later than the period
covered by this volume, things continued to be written in verse
which were merely pamphlets, and gave us both matter of eternity,
such as <i>Absalom and  Achitophel</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> or <i>Religio Laici</i>, and hard-bound
doggerel like Defoe's <i>True-Born Englishman</i> and <i>Jure Divino</i>. The
Elizabethan verse pamphlet, which was largely written by Thomas
Churchyard, Nicholas Breton, John Davies, Samuel Rowlands, and others,
is a curiosity, but as a rule very little more; and I do not propose
to give any examples of it here. Nor, the space at my command being
all too limited, have I thought it necessary to draw in this present
volume on the miscellaneous pamphlets of the times. The examples will
be taken from what may be called the great single pamphleteers or
pamphlet collections&mdash;that is to say, Lodge, Greene, Nash, Harvey,
'Martin Marprelate' and the anti-Martinists, Breton, and Dekker. Some
particulars of each of the selected authors or groups may appropriately
be given in this introduction.</p>

<p>No minor Elizabethan author is better known than Robert Greene,
partly from the fact that he touches Shakespeare, and partly from the
other fact that his short and ill-spent life was that of the typical
Bohemian, and so interests those who like gossip about men of letters.
He was born in 1560 at Norwich, was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge
(being also subsequently incorporated at Oxford), travelled on the
Continent, married, treated his wife very badly, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> have been both a
clerk in orders and a student of medicine, lived recklessly in London
as a dramatist and pamphleteer, and died at the age of thirty-two
either <i>propter</i> or merely <i>post</i> undue consumption of pickled herrings
and Rhenish wine. His plays, though full of the ante-Shakespearian
crudity and unskilled workmanship, have many graceful touches; the
songs which he scattered about both his plays and his poems are
frequently charming; his pamphlets, which, short as his life was, are
very numerous, perhaps rank, on the whole, above those of any other
Elizabethan writer for combined bulk, variety, and merit. They were
produced in the space of about ten years (1583-92). Those certainly
known to be his, or probably attributed to him, are nearly thirty in
number, and almost defy classification. Some of them approach that
strange type of novel consisting of a minimum of story, a maximum of
moralising, and, if I may say so, a <i>plusquam</i>-maximum of conceited
style, the example of which had been set in Lyly's <i>Euphues</i>. Not a
few are personal reminiscences&mdash;how far deliberately imbued with an
exaggerated profession of repentance in order to hit readers with
both barrels it is very hard to say. A distinct and very interesting
set deals with the ways of the Eliza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>bethan 'conny-catcher,' the
'Captain Rook' (though usually of lower grade) of the time. Others are
pure book-making, as we should call it now, about subjects which for
political or other reasons happened to be in the public eye at the
moment. Greene is certainly one of the most typical of his fellowship.</p>

<p>With him and close to him may be ranked Thomas Lodge, who was his
contemporary, and for a time his comrade; but who, unlike Greene,
settled down as a Roman Catholic physician, and outliving the hapless
'Roberto' more than thirty years, did not die till the last year of
James. Lodge had perhaps higher powers than Greene, except in drama.
One of his pamphlets, 'Rosalynde' or 'Euphues' Golden Legacy', gave
Shakespeare, as most people now know, the subject of <i>As You Like
It</i>, and has been more than once reprinted for that reason. He had
also a faculty of which Greene shows no trace whatever&mdash;that of an
accomplished literary critic; and twice, in answer to Gosson and
Campion, took the right side against some of the literary heresies
which animated that active and fruitful time. He was decidedly best in
the euphuist romance, but he also practised the social satire pamphlet
with no small success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Nash and Harvey shared with Greene the luck, good or other, of being
earlier presented in their lives, and in at least some of their works,
to modern writers than their fellows. Indeed, Greene's not wholly
enviable fame is as much due to the quarrels of these two as to his
own works. Gabriel Harvey, the elder but very much the less able
of the two, was a Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, a friend
of Sidney and of Spenser (whose <i>Faërie Queene</i> he unmercifully
snubbed, preferring the curious fancy of classical metres which was
long patronised by the 'Areopagus' or Sidneian clique), and a man
of real scholarship. But his exemplification of the worst faults
of the university prig, and the pitiless exposure of them in his
controversy with Thomas Nash (a younger Cambridge man, and wielder
of the sharpest and most unscrupulous pen of his time), have brought
down such hard language on him from most literary historians that one
or two charitable or paradoxical souls have been tempted to take up
the cudgels on his side. To this length, I cannot go. Why Harvey and
Nash quarrelled no one knows exactly; but the quarrel, the pamphlet
results of which make up the greater part of Harvey's work, plays only
a small part in that of Nash. The very quarrel itself had, or seems
to have had, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>thing to do with the strange Marprelate business
to be noticed presently, and Nash is at least with great probability
supposed author of some of the chief numbers of that controversy on the
anti-Martinist side. But he wrote not a little other pamphlet-matter,
never quite attempting the euphuist romance in which his friends
Greene and Lodge delighted, but producing discourses of apparitions
in anticipation of Defoe, pious tractates expressing, or professing
to express, his repentance for evil living, puffs (though this is
rather an unkind word), such as his <i>Lenten Stuff</i>, eulogistic of the
herrings which were the staple commodity of his native coast, and a
curious book called <i>The Unfortunate Traveller</i>, dealing with the grand
tour, and containing among other things the well-known romance (for
romance it would seem to be) of Surrey the poet and his Geraldine.
Where Nash stands eminent among the writers of the time is in his
faculty of boisterous and burlesque abuse, which, in his famous lampoon
upon Harvey, <i>Have with you to Saffron Walden</i> (Harvey's birthplace),
displayed itself in a manner not easy to parallel elsewhere in English.</p>

<p>It is very hard to give in very brief space an account of the Martin
Marprelate matter, yet without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> some such account extracts from it must
be hardly intelligible. It began about the year 1588, chiefly owing
to the action of a certain Reverend Nicholas Udall, a puritan divine
who struck into the controversy between the Episcopal and Presbyterian
parties in the Church, and embittered it by the use of language so
violent that he himself was imprisoned and his printer's press seized.
This printer, Waldegrave, enraged thereat, lent his art to members of
the puritan sect even more violent than Udall (their exact identity is
matter of controversy), and a fire of pamphlets was opened by them, the
earliest being called <i>The Epistle</i> and <i>The Epitome</i>. In the first
place, Dean Bridges of Salisbury and Bishop Cooper of Winchester, then
other dignitaries, were assailed with real vigour and ability, but
with the most unscrupulous partisanship, and in a dialect which for
extravagance of abusive language had not been surpassed in the heat of
the earlier Reformation controversies, and has scarcely been approached
since. The partisans of the Church were fully equal to the occasion;
and a counter fire of pamphlets, some of which are attributed with
great probability to Nash, and others with hardly less to the Oxford
dramatist and euphuist Lyly, was returned. The heat of the controversy
lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> chiefly through three years&mdash;1588, 1589, and 1590; but it may
be said in the widest sense to have endured for nearly seven&mdash;from
1586 to 1593, when Penry and Barrow, the supposed chiefs of the
Martinists, were executed. Of the style of this singular controversy
the extract will, I trust, give a sufficient idea. As to its matter,
it is difficult to be more precise than this: that the object of the
Martinist pamphleteers was to decry episcopacy by every possible
description of personal abuse, applied to the holders and the defenders
of the episcopal office, and that the object of their opponents of the
same class (for men like Cooper and Bridges, still more like Whitgift
and Hooker, stand in an entirely different category) was not so much to
defend that office as to fling back in double measure the abuse upon
'Martin,' as the generic name went, and upon his known or supposed
embodiments and partisans.</p>

<p>There can be few greater contrasts than between this furious ribaldry,
as it too often is, and the mild mediocrity of Nicholas Breton. His
claim to a place here (even if his merit be rated much lower than some
have rated it) is, that he is the chief writer of the kind who is both
in verse and prose a pamphleteer pure and simple. You cannot (at least
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> cannot) call Breton a poet, but he wrote immense quantities of
verse, and in prose he pamphleted with such copiousness and persistence
for nearly half a century, that it is clear there must have been money
to be made by the practice.</p>

<p>The last of our chief single authors is Thomas Dekker, a very much
greater man than Breton, though not so great in prose as in verse. He
was somewhat later even in his beginning than the other writers I have
noticed; and though his prose has not the formal merit or charm of his
exquisite songs and his wonderful romantic character in drama, it is
very interesting in matter. He paraphrases (<i>The Bachelor's Banquet</i>,
<i>The Gull's Hornbook</i>) with remarkable freedom and skill; he chronicles
plague years; he takes a hint from Greene, and extends and varies that
author's satirical exposition of London tricks in a long and extremely
vivid series of pamphlets, such as <i>The Bellman of London</i>, <i>The Seven
Deadly Sins of London</i>, <i>Lanthorn and Candle Light</i>, <i>News from Hell</i>,
and half a dozen others. In these, though of course a certain allowance
must be made for the pressman's exaggeration in dealing with such
subjects, there is a most singular and interesting picture of the lower
and looser classes in England, at least in the English capital, at the
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>

<p>In this little book, after one or two changes of plan, I have finally
decided on giving only entire pamphlets&mdash;a specimen of literary
criticism from Lodge, of autobiographic romance from Greene, of
politico-religious controversy from the Martin Marprelate series, of
mingled self-panegyric and lampoon from Harvey, of burlesque from Nash,
of paraphrase of foreign matter adapted to English conditions from
Dekker, and of what may be called hack-work for the press from Breton.
The annotation is deliberately limited to the removal of some of the
most obvious stumbling-blocks to current reading. A full commentary on
<i>The Gull's Hornbook</i> alone would fill another volume, and the object
in these books is to give text not comment.</p>

<h2><a name="I_THOMAS_LODGE" id="I_THOMAS_LODGE">I.&mdash;THOMAS LODGE</a></h2>

<p>(<i>Stephen Gosson's</i> Schoole of Abuse <i>has acquired something like fame
in virtue of one of the answers to it&mdash;Sidney's</i> Defence of Poetry.
<i>That interesting little book has been frequently reprinted of late,
and some knowledge of it, and of Gosson's attack which caused it,
may be taken as common. Lodge's attempt, made as a very young man,
to do what Sidney did is far less familiar even to students. It was
reprinted in 1853, and again in the rare and costly private issue
by the Hunterian Club of Lodge's whole works; but the author of the
introductory essay to that issue, my friend Mr. Gosse, has been
somewhat unkind (I cannot say unjust) to it. It is, indeed, no great
thing; but as a very early example of literary criticism by pamphlet,
which has lacked the modern reprinting accorded to Webbe, Puttenham,
Daniel, and other critics of the same time, I thought it might find
appropriate place here.</i>)</p>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">A Reply to Stephen Gosson's Schoole of Abuse in Defence of Poetry,

<p><i>Protogenes</i> can know <i>Apelles</i> by his line though he se[e] him not,
and wise men can consider by the Penn the aucthoritie of the writer,
thoughe they know him not. The Rubie is discerned by his pale rednes,
and who hath not h[e]ard that the Lyon is knowne by hys clawes. Though
<i>Æsopes</i> craftie crowe be never so deftlye decked, yet is his double

the shadow of ther follies: and bestowing every fether in the bodye
of the right M. tourne out the naked dissembler into his owen cote,
as a spectacle of follye to all those which can rightlye judge what
imperfections be.</p>

<p>There came to my hands lately a litle (woulde God a wittye) pamphelet,
baring a fayre face as though it were the sc[h]oole of abuse, but
being by me advisedly wayed I fynd it the oftscome of imperfections,
the writer fuller of wordes than judgement; the matter certainely as
ridiculus as seri[o]us. Asuredly his mother witte wrought this wonder,
the child to disprayse his father, the dogg to byte his mayster for
his dainty morcell. But I se[e] (with <i>Seneca</i>) yt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> wrong is to

not, partly that he may se his owne follie, and partly that I may
discharge my promise, both binde me. Therefore I would with the good
scholmayster to over looke his abuses againe with me, so shall he
see an ocean of inormities which begin in his first prinsiple in the
disprayse of poetry.</p>

<p>And first let me familiarly consider with this find faulte what the
learned have alwayes esteemed of poetrie. <i>Seneca</i> thoughe a stoike
would have a poeticall sonne, and amongst the auncientest <i>Homer</i> was
no les accompted than <i>Humanus deus</i>. What made Alexander I pray you
esteme of him so much? Why allotted he for his works so curious a
closset? Was ther no fitter under prop for his pillow the[n] a simple
pamphelet? In all <i>Darius</i> cofers was there no Jewell so costly?
Forso[o]th my thinks these two (the one the father of Philosophers,
the other the cheftaine of chivalrie) were both deceived if all were
as a <i>Gosson</i> would wish them, yf poets paynt naughte but palterie
toyes in vearse, their studies tended to folishnesse, and in all their
inde[a]vors they did naught els but <i>agendo nihil agere</i>. Lord how
Virgil's poore gnatt pricketh him, and how Ovid's fley byteth him, he
can beare no bourde, he hath raysed up a new sect of seri[o]us stoikes,
that can abide naught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> but their owen shadowe, and alow nothing
worthye, but what they conceave. Did you never reade (my over wittie
frend) that under the persons of beastes many abuses were dissiphered?
Have you not reason to waye? that whatsoever e[i]ther Virgil did write
of his gnatt, or Ovid of his fley, was all covertly to declare abuse?
But you are (<i>homo literatus</i>) a man of the letter, little savoring of
learning, your giddy brain made you leave your thrift, and your abuses
in London some part of your honestie. You say that Poets are subtil,
if so, you have learned that poynt of them, you can well glose on a
trifleling text: but you have dronke perhaps of <i>Lethe</i>, your gram[m]er
learning is out of your head, you forget your Accidence, you reme[m]ber
not that under the person of <i>Æneas</i> in Virgil, the practice of a
dilligent captaine is discribed, under ye shadow of byrds, beastes,
and trees, the follies of the world were disiphered, you know not
that the creation is signified in the Image of <i>Prometheus</i>, the fall
of pryde in the person of <i>Narcissus</i>, these are toyes because they
savour of wisedom which you want. Marke what <i>Campanus</i> sayth, <i>Mira
fabularum vanitas sed quæ si introspiciantur videri possunt non vanæ</i>.
The vanitie of tales is wonderful, yet if we advisedly looke into them
they wil seme and prove wise. How wonderful are the pithie poems of
<i>Cato</i>! the curious comidies of <i>Plautus</i>! how bravely discovereth
<i>Terence</i> our imperfectio[n] in his <i>Eunuch</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> how neatly dissiphereth
he <i>Dauus</i>! how pleasauntly paynteth he out <i>Gnatho</i>! whom if we should
seeke in our dayes, I suppose he would not be farr from your parson.
But I see you woulde seeme to be that which you are not, and as the
proverb sayth <i>Nodum in Cirpo quærere</i>. Poets you say use coullors to
cover their incoviences, and wittie sentences to burnish theyr bawdery,
and you divinite to cover your knaverye.</p>

<p>But tell mee truth <i>Gosson</i>, speakest thou as thou thinkest? What
coelers findest thou in a Poete not to be admitted? Are his speaches
unperfect? Savor they of inscience? I think if thou hast any shame thou
canst not but like and approve the[m]. Are ther gods displesant unto
thee? doth <i>Saturne</i> in his majesty move thee? doth <i>Juno</i> with her
riches displease thee? doth <i>Minerva</i> with her weapon discomfort thee?
doth <i>Apollo</i> with his harping harme thee? Thou mayst say nothing les
then harme thee because they are not, and I thinke so to[o] because
thou knowest them not. For wot thou that in the person of <i>Saturne</i>
our decaying yearss are signified, in the picture of angry <i>Juno</i>
our affections are dissiphered, in ye person of <i>Minerva</i> is our
understa[n]ding signified, both in respect of warre, as policie. When
they faine that <i>Pallas</i> was begotten of the braine of <i>Jupiter</i> their
meaning is none other but that al wisdome (as the learned say) is from
above, and commeth from the father of Lights: in the portrature of
<i>Apollo</i> all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> knowledge is denocated. So that, what so they wrot it was
to this purpose, in the way of pleasure to draw men to wisedome: for
se[e]ing the world in those daies was unperfect, yt was necessary that
they like good Phisi[ci]ons should so frame their potions, that they
might be appliable to the quesie stomaks of their werish patients. But
our studientes by your meanes have made shipwrack of theyr labors, our
schoole-maisters have so offended that by your judgement they shall
<i>subire p&oelig;nam capitis</i> for teaching poetry, the universitie is litle
beholding to you, al their practices in teaching are frivolus. Witt
hath wrought that in you, that yeares and studie never set[t]led in the
heads of our sagest doctors.</p>

<p>No mervel though you disprayse poetrye, when you know not what it
meanes. <i>Erasmus</i> will make that the pathwaye to knowledge which you
disprayse, and no meane fathers vouchsafe in their seriouse questions
of divinitie, to inserte poeticall sensures.</p>

<p>I think if we shal wel overloke ye Philosophers, we shal find their
judgeme[n]ts not halfe perfect. Poetes you say fayle in their fables,
Philosophers in the verye secrets of Nature. Though <i>Plato</i> could
wish the expulsion of Poetes from his well publiques, which he might
doe with reason, yet the wisest had not all that same opinion, it had
bene better for him to have se[a]rcht more narowly what the soule
was, for his definition was verye frivolus, when he would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> it
naught els but <i>Substantiam intelectu predictam</i>. If you say that
Poetes did labour about nothing, tell me (I besech you) what wonders
wroughte those your dunce Doctors in ther reasons <i>de ente et non
ente</i>, in theyr definition of no force and les witt? How sweate they
power soules in makinge more things then co[u]ld be! That I may use
your owne phrase, did not they spende one candle by seeking another?
<i>Democritus Epicurus</i> with ther scholler <i>Metrodorus</i> how labored they
in finding out more worlds the[n] one? Your <i>Plato</i> in midst of his
presisnes wrought that absurdite that never may be redd in Poets, to
make a yearthly creature to beare the person of the creator, and a
corruptible substaunce an incomprehensible God: for determining of the
principall causes of all thinges, a made them naughte els but an <i>Idea</i>
which if it be conferred wyth the truth, his sentence will savour of
Inscience. But I speake for Poetes, I answeare your abuse, therefore I
will disprove or disprayse naught, but wish you with the wise <i>Plato</i>,
to disprayse that thing you offend not in.</p>

<p><i>Seneca</i> sayth that the studdie of Poets is to make childre[n] ready
to the understanding of wisedom, and yt our auncients did teache
<i>artes Eleutherias. i. liberales</i>, because the instructed childre[n]
by the instrume[n]t of knowledg in time became <i>homines liberi. i.
Philosophye</i>. It may be that in reding of poetry, it happened to you as
it is with the Oyster, for she in her swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> receiveth no ayre, and
you in your reeding lesse instruction. It is reported that the shepe of
Euboia want ther gale, and one the contrarye side that the beastes of
<i>Naxus</i> have <i>distentum fel</i>. Men hope that scollers should have witt
brought upp in the Universite, but your sweet selfe with the cattell
of Euboia, since you left your College have lost your learning. You
disprayse <i>Maximinus Tirius</i> pollicey, and that thinge that he wrott to
manifest learned Poets meaning, you atribute to follye. O holy hedded
man, why may not <i>Juno</i> resemble the ayre? why not <i>Alexander</i> valour?
why not <i>Ulisses</i> pollice? Will you have all for you[r] owne tothe?
Must men write that you maye know theyr meaning as though your wytt
were to wrest all things? Alas simple <i>Irus</i>, begg at knowledge gate
awhile, thou haste not wonne the mastery of learning. Weane thyself
to wisedome, and use thy tallant in zeale not for envie, abuse not
thy knowledge in dispraysing that which is pereles: I shold blush
from a player, to become an enviouse preacher, if thou hadst zeale to
preach, if for <i>Sions</i> sake thou co[u]ldst not holde thy tongue, thy
true dealing were prayse worthy, thy revolting woulde counsell me to
reverence thee. Pittie weare it that poetrye should be displaced, full
little could we want <i>Buchanan's</i> workes, and <i>Boetius</i> comfortes may
not be banished. What made <i>Erasmus</i> labor in <i>Euripides</i> tragedies?
Did he inde[a]vour by painting them out of Greeke into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> Latine to
manifest sinne unto us, or to confirm us in goodnes? Labor (I pray
thee) in Pamphelets more prayse worthy; thou haste not saved a Senator,
therefore not worthye a Lawrell wre[a]th, thou hast not (in disproving
poetry) reproved an abuse, and therfore not worthy commendation.</p>

<p><i>Seneca</i> sayth that <i>Magna vitæ pars elabitur male agentibus, maxima
nihill agentibus, tota aliud agentibus</i>, the most of our life (sayd he)
is spent e[i]ther in doing evill, or nothing, or that wee should not,
and I would wish you weare exempted from this sensure. Geve eare but
a little more what may be said for poetrie, for I must be briefe. You
have made so greate matter that I may not stay on one thing to[o] long,
lest I leave another untouched.</p>

<p>And first whereas you say, yt <i>Tullie</i> in his yeres of more judgement
despised Poetes, harke (I pray you) what he worketh for them in his
oratio[n] <i>pro Archia poeta</i>. But before you heare him, least you
fayle in the incounter, I would wysh you to follow the advise of the
dasterdlye Ichneumon of <i>Ægipt</i>, who when shee beholdeth the Aspis her
enemye to drawe nighe, calleth her fellowes together, bisme[a]ring
herselfe with claye, against the byting and stroke of the serpent, arme
yourselfe, cal your witts together: want not your wepons, lest your
inperfect judgement be rewardede with Midas eares. You had neede play
the night burd now, for yon day Owl hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> misconned his parte, and for
to-who now a dayes he cryes foole you: which hath brought such a sort
of wondering birds about your eares, as I feare me will chatter you out
of your Ivey bush. The worlde shames to see you, or els you are afrayde
to shew yourselfe.</p>

<p>You thought poetrye should want a patron (I think) when you fyrste
published this invective, but yet you fynd al to[o] many eve[n]
<i>preter expectation&#275;</i>, yea though it can speake for it self, yet
her patron <i>Tullie</i> now shall tell her tale, <i>Hæc studia</i>, (sayth
he) <i>adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant,
adversis perfugium ac Solatium prebent, delectant domi, non impediunt
foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregri[n]antur rusticantur</i>. Then will you
disprayse yt which all men commend? You looke only upon ye refuse of ye
abuse, nether respecting the importance of ye matter nor the weighe of
ye wryter.</p>

<p><i>Solon</i> can fayne himself madde, to further the Athenians. <i>Chaucer</i>
in pleasant vain can rebuke sin uncontrold, and though he be lavish in
the letter, his sence is serious. Who in Rome lame[n]ted not Roscius
death? And ca[n]st thou suck no plesure out of thy <i>M. Claudians</i>
writings? Hark what <i>Cellarius</i> a learned father attributed to it,
<i>acuit memoriam</i> (saith he) it profiteth the memory. Yea, and <i>Tully</i>
attributeth it for prais to <i>Archias</i> yt upon any theame he co[u]ld
versify exte[m]pory. Who liketh not of the promptness of <i>Ovid</i>? Who
not unworthely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> co[u]ld boast of himself thus <i>Quicquid conabar dicere
versus erat</i>. Who then doothe not wonder at poetry? Who thinketh not
yt it procedeth fro[m] above? What made ye Chians and Colophonians
fal to such controversy? Why seke ye Smirnians to recover fro[m] ye
Salaminians the prais of <i>Homer</i>? Al wold have him to be of ther city,
I hope not for harme, but because of his knoledge. <i>Themistocles</i>
desireth to be acquainted with those w<sup>c</sup> could best discipher his
praises. Even <i>Marius</i> himselfe, tho never so cruel, acco[m]pted
of <i>Plotinus</i> poems. What made <i>Aphricanus</i> esteme <i>Ennius</i>? Why
did Alexander give prais to <i>Achilles</i> but for ye prayses which he
found writte[n] of hym by <i>Homer</i>? Why estemed <i>Pompie</i> so muche of
<i>Theophanes Mitiletus</i>, or <i>Brutus</i> so greatlye the wrytinges of
<i>Accius</i>? <i>Fuluius</i> was so great a favorer of poetry, that after
the Aetolian warres, he attributed to the Muses those spoiles that
belonged to Mars. In all the Romaine conquest, h[e]ardest thou ever of
a slayne Poete? nay rather the Emperours honored them, beautified them
with benefites, and decked their sanctuaries which [with] sacrifice.
<i>Pindarus</i> colledg is not fit for spoil of <i>Alexander</i> overcome,
nether feareth poetry ye persecutors sword. What made <i>Austin</i> so
much affectate ye heavenly fury? not folly, for if I must needes
speake, <i>illud non ausim affirmare</i>, his zeale was in setting up the
house of God, not in affectate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> eloquence, he wrot not, he accompted
not. He honnored not, so much that (famous poetry) whyche we prayse,
without cause, for if it be true that <i>Horace</i> reporteth in his booke
<i>de arte poetica</i>, all the answeares of the Oracles weare in verse.
Among the precise Jewes you shall find Poetes, and for more majestie
<i>Sibilla</i> will prophesie in verse. <i>Hiroaldus</i> can witnes with me, that
<i>David</i> was a poet, and that his vayne was in imitating (as S. Jerom
witnesseth) <i>Horace</i>, <i>Flaccus</i>, and <i>Pindarus</i>, somtimes his verse
runneth in an <i>Iambus</i> foote, anone he hath recourse to a <i>Saphier</i>
vaine, and <i>aliquando, semipede ingreditur</i>. Ask <i>Josephus</i>, and he
will tel you that Esay, Job and Salomon voutsafed poetical practises,
for (if <i>Origen</i> and he fault not) theyre verse was <i>Hexameter and
pentameter</i>. Enquire of <i>Cassiodorus</i>, he will say that all the
beginning of Poetrye proceeded from the Scripture. <i>Paulinus</i> tho the
byshop of <i>Nolanum</i> yet voutsafe the name of a Poet, and <i>Ambrose</i>
tho he be a patriarke in <i>mediolan&#363;</i> loveth versising. <i>Beda</i>
shameth not ye science that shamelesse <i>Gosson</i> misliketh. Reade
over <i>Lactantius</i>, his proofe is by poetry, and <i>Paul</i> voutsafeth to
overlooke <i>Epimenides</i>; let the Apostle preach at Athens he disdaineth
not of Aratus authorite. It is a pretye sentence yet not so prety as
pithy, <i>Poeta nascitur orator fit</i>, as who should say, Poetrye commeth
from above from a heavenly seate of a glorious God unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> an excellent
creature man, an orator is but made by exercise. For if wee examine
well what befell <i>Ennius</i> amonge the Romans, and Hesiodus among his
co[u]ntrimen the Gretians, howe they came by theyr knowledge whence
they receved their heavenly furye, the first will tell us that sleping
upon the Mount of Parnassus he dreamed that he received the soule of
<i>Homer</i> into him, after the which he became a Poete, the next will
assure you that it commeth not by labor, nether that night watchings
bringeth it, but yt we must have it thence whence he fetched it w<sup>c</sup> was
(he saith) fro[m] a wel of ye Muses w<sup>c</sup> <i>Cabelimus</i> calleth <i>Por&#363;</i>,
a draught whereof drewe him to his perfection, so of a shephard he
becam an eloque[n]t poet.</p>

<p>Wel the[n] you see yt it commeth not by exercise of play making, nether
insertio[n] of gawds, but from nature and from above: and I hope yt
<i>Aristotle</i> hath sufficiently taught you that <i>Natura nihil fecit
frustra</i>.</p>

<p><i>Perseus</i> was made a poete <i>divino furore percitus</i>. And whereas the
poets were sayde to call for the Muses helpe ther mening was no other
as <i>Iodocus Badius</i> reporteth, but to call for heavenly inspiration
from above to direct theyr ende[a]vors. Nether were it good for you
to sette light by the name of a poet since ye oftspring from whence
he cometh is so heavenly. <i>Sibilla</i> in hir answers to <i>Æneas</i> against
hir will as the poet telleth us was possessed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> thys fury, ye wey
consideratly but of the writing of poets, and you shal se[e] than
whe[n] ther matter is most heavenly, their stile is most loftye, a
strange token of the wonderfull efficacy of the same.</p>

<p>I would make a long discourse unto you of <i>Platos</i> 4. furies but I
le[a]ve them. It pitieth me to bring a rodd of your owne making to
beate you wythal. But mithinks while you heare thys I see you swallowe
down your owne spittle for revenge, where (God wot) my wryting savoreth
not of envye. In this case I coulde wyshe you fare farre otherwyse from
your foe. If you please I wyll become your frende and see what a potion
or receypt I can frame fytt for your diet. And herein I will prove
myselfe a practiser, before I purdge you, you shall take a preparative
to disburden your heavy hedde of those grose follis you have conceved:
but the receipt is bitter, therefore I would wysh you first to casten
your mouth with the Suger of persevera[n]ce: for ther is a cold collop
yt must downe your throate yet suche a one as shall change your
complection quit[e]. I wyll have you therfore to tast first of yt cold
river <i>Phricus</i> in Thratia, which as <i>Aristotle</i> reporteth changeth
blacke into white; or of Scamandar, which maketh gray yalow, yt is of
an envious ma[n] a wel minded person, reprehending of zeale yt wherin
he hath sinned by folly, and so being prepard, thy purgation wyll worke
more easy, thy understandinge wyll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> more perfit, thou shalt blush at
thy abuse, and reclaime thy selfe by force of argument. So will thou
prove of clene recovered patient, and I a perfecte practiser in framing
so good a potion. This broughte to passe, I with the[e] wil seeke out
some abuse in poetry, which I will seeke for to disprove by reason
first pronounced by no smal birde even <i>Aristotle</i> himself. <i>Poetae</i>
(sayth he) <i>multa mentiuntur</i> and to further his opinion seuer <i>Cato</i>
putteth in his cencure.</p>

<p><i>Admiranda canunt sed non credenda poetæ.</i> These were sore blemishes
if objected rightly and heare you may say the streme runnes a wronge,
but if it be so by you[r] leve I wyll bring him shortly in his right
chanel. My answere shall not be my owne, but a learned father shall
tell my tale, if you wil know his right name men call him <i>Lactantius</i>:
who in hys book <i>de divinis institutionibus</i> reesoneth thus. I suppose
(sayth he) Poets are full of credit, and yet it is requesite for those
that wil understand them to be admonished, that among them not onely
the name but the matter beareth a show of that it is not: for if sayth
he we examine the Scriptures litterallye nothing will seeme more falls,
and if we way Poetes wordes and not ther meaning, our learning in
them wilbe very mene. You see nowe your <i>Catoes</i> judgement as of no
force and that all your objections you make agaynst poetrye be of no
valor, yet lest you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> should be altogether discouraged I wyll helpe you
forwarde a little more, it pities me to consider the weaknes of your
cause, I wyll therfore make your strongest reason more strong and after
I have builded it up destroy it agayn. Poets you confesse are eloquent
but you reprove them in their wantonnesse, they write of no wisedom,
you may say their tales are frivolus, they prophane holy thinges, they
seeke nothing to the perfection of our soules. Theyr practise is in
other things of lesse force: to this objection I answer no otherwise
then <i>Horace</i> doeth in his booke <i>de arte poetica</i> where he wryteth
thus:</p>

<p>I cannot leave <i>Tirtheus</i> pollicy untouched, who by force of his pen
could incite men to the defence of theyr countrye. If you require of ye
Oracle of <i>Apollo</i> what successe you shal have: <i>respondet bellicoso
numine</i>. Lo now you see your objections my answers, you behold or may
perceive manifestlye that Poetes was the first raysors of cities,
prescribers of good lawes, mayntayners of religion, disturbors of
the wicked, advancers of the wel disposed, inve[n]tors of laws, and
lastly the very fo[o]tpaths to knowledg and understa[n]ding. Ye if
we sho[u]ld beleve Herome he will make <i>Platos</i> exiles honest me[n]
and his pestiferous poets good preachers: for he accounteth <i>Orpheus
Museus and Linus, Christians</i>, therefore <i>Virgil</i> (in his 6 boke
of <i>Æneiados</i> wher he lernedly describeth ye journey of <i>Æneas</i> to
<i>Elisum</i>) asserteneth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> us, yt among them yt were ther for the zeale
they beare toward there country, ther wer found <i>Quinque pii vates et
Ph&oelig;bo digna loquti</i> but I must answer al objectio[n]s, I must fil
every nooke. I must arme myself now, for here is the greatest bob I
can gather out of your booke forsoth <i>Ovids</i> abuses, in descrybing
whereof you labour very vehementlye termi[n]g him letcher, and in his
person dispraise all poems, but shall on[e] mans follye destroye a
universal comodity? What gift what perfit knowledg hath ther bin, emong
ye professors of w<sup>c</sup> ther hath not bin a bad on [?] the Angels have
sinned in heave[n], <i>Ada[m] and Eve</i> in earthly paradise, emo[n]g ye
holy apostles ungratious Judas. I reson not yt al poets are holy but
I affirme yt poetry is a heave[n]ly gift, a perfit gift then which I
know not greater plesure. And surely if I may speak my mind I thi[n]k
we shall find but few poets if it were exactly wayd what they oughte to
be: your <i>Muscovian</i> straungers, your <i>Scithian</i> monsters wonderful, by
one <i>Eurus</i> brought upon one stage in ships made of Sheepeskins, wyll
not prove you a poet nether your life alow you to bee of that learning:
if you had wisely wayed ye abuse of poetry, if you had reprehended ye
foolish fantasies of our poets <i>nomine non re</i> which they bring forth
on stage, my self would have liked of you and allowed your labor. But
I perceive nowe yt all red colloured stones are not Rubies, nether is
every one <i>Alexandar</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> yt hath a stare in his cheeke, al lame men are
not <i>Vulcans</i>, nor hooke nosed men <i>Ciceroes</i>, nether each professer
a poet, I abhore those poets that savor of ribaldry, I will with the
zealous admit the expullcion of suche enormities. Poetry is dispraised
not for the folly that is in it, but for the abuse whiche manye ill
Wryters couller by it. Beleeve me the magestrats may take advise (as I
knowe wisely can) to roote out those odd rymes which runnes in every
rascales mouth. Savoring of rybaldry, those foolishe ballets that are
admitted make poets good and godly practises to be refused. I like not
of a wicked <i>Nero</i> that wyll expell <i>Lucan</i>, yet admit I of a zealous
governour that wil seke to take away the abuse of poetry. I like not
of an angrye <i>Augustus</i> which wyll banishe <i>Ovid</i> for envy. I love a
wise Senator, which in wisedome wyll correct him and with advise burne
his follyes: unhappy were we yf like poore <i>Scaurus</i> we shoulde find
<i>Tiberius</i> that wyll put us to death for a tragedy making, but most
blessed were we if we might find a judge that severely would amende
the abuses of Tragedies. But I leave the reformation thereof to more
wyser than my selfe, and retourne to Gosson whom I wyshe to be fully
perswaded in this cause, and therefore I will tell hym a prety story,
which <i>Justin</i> wryteth in the prayse of poetrye.</p>

<p>The <i>Lacedemonians</i> when they had loste many men in divers incountryes
with theyr enemyes soughte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> to the Oracles of Apollo requiring how
they myght recover theyr losses, it was answered that they mighte
overcome if so be they could get an <i>Athenian</i> governor, whereupon they
sent Orators unto the <i>Athenians</i> humbly requesting them that they
woulde appoynt them out one of theyr best captaynes: the <i>Athenians</i>
owinge them old malice, sent them in steede of a <i>soldado vechio</i> a
scholar of the Muses: in steede of a worthy warrior a poore poet;
for a couragious <i>Themistocles</i> a silly <i>Tirthetus</i>, a man of great
eloquence and singuler wytte, yet was he but a lame lymde captaine
more fit for the co[u]che than the field. The <i>Lacedemonians</i> trusting
the Oracle, received the champion, and fearing the government of a
stranger, made him ther Citizen. Which once done and he obteining the
Dukdome, he assended the theater, and ther very learnedly, wyshing
them to forget theyr folly, and to thinke on victory, they being
acuate by his eloque[n]ce waging battail won the fielde. Lo now you
see that the framing of common welthes, and defence thereof proceedeth
from poets, how dare you therfore open your mouth against them? How
can you disprayse the preserver of a countrye? You compare <i>Homer</i> to
<i>Methecus</i>, cookes to Poetes, you shame your selfe in your unreverent
similitud[e]s, you may see your follyes <i>verbum sapienti sat</i>: whereas
<i>Homar</i> was an ancient poet you disalow him, and accompte of those
of lesser judgement. <i>Strabo</i> calleth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> poetry <i>primam sapientiam</i>.
Cicero in his firste of his Tusculans attributeth ye invencion of
philosophy to poets. God keepe us from a Plato that should expel such
men. Pittie were it that the memory of these valiant victours should
be hidden, which have dyed in the behalfe of ther countryes: miserable
were our state yf we wanted those worthy volumes of poetry. Could the
learned beare the losse of Homer? or our younglings the wrytings of
the <i>Mantuan</i>? or you your volumes of historyes? beleve me yf you had
wanted your Mysteries of nature, and your stately storyes, your booke
would have scarce bene ledde wyth matter. If therefore you will deale
in things of wisdome, correct the abuse, honor the science, renewe
your schoole, crye out over Hierusalem wyth the prophet the woe that
he pronounced, wish the teacher to reforme hys lyfe, that his weake
scholler may prove the wyser, cry out against unsaciable desyre in rich
men, tel the house of Jacob theyr iniquities, lament with the Apostle
the want of laborers in the Lords vineyards, cry out on those dume
doggs that will not barke, wyll the mightye that they overmayster not
the poore, and put downe the beggers prowde heart by thy perswasions.
Thunder oute with the Prophete <i>Micha</i> the mesage of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
and with hym desyre the Judges to heare thee, the Prynces of Jacob to
hearken to thee, and those of the house of Israell to understande.
Then tell them that they abhorre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> judgement, and prevent equitie, that
they judge for rewardes, and that theyr priests teach for hyre, and
the prophets thereof prophesie for money, and yet that they saye the
Lorde is wyth them, and that no evil can befall them, breath[e] out the
sweete promises to the good, the cursses to the badde, tell them that
a peeace muste needes have a warre, and that God can raise up another
Zenacherib, shew the[m] that Salomons kingdome was but for a season and
that adversitie cometh ere we espye it. These be the songes of Sion,
these be those rebukes which you oughte to add to abuses; recover the
body for it is sore, the appedices thereof will easily be reformed, if
that wear at a staye.</p>

<p>But other matters call me and I must not staye upon this onely, there
is an easier task in hand for me, and that which, if I may speak my
conscience, fitteth my vain best, your second abuse Gosson, your
second abuse; your disprayses of Musik, which you unadvisedly terme
pyping: that is it will most byte you, what so is a overstay of life,
is displesant to your person, musik may not stand in your presence,
whereas all the learned Philosophers have alwayes had it in reverence.
<i>Homar</i> commendeth it highly, referring to the prayses of the Gods
whiche Gosson accompteth folishnesse; looke uppon the harmonie of the
Heavens; hang they not by Musik? Doe not the <i>Spheares</i> move? The
<i>primus</i> motor governe[s], be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> they <i>inferiora corpora</i> affected
<i>quadam sumpathia</i> and agreement? Howe can we measure the debilitie
of the patient but by the disordered motion of the pulse? Is not man
worse accompted of when he is most out of tune? Is there any thinge
that more affecteth the sense? Doth there any pleasure more acuat our
understanding? Can the wonders yt hath wroughte and which you your
selfe confesse no more move you? It fitteth well nowe that the learned
have sayd, <i>musica requirit generosum animu[m]</i> which since it is
far from you, no marvel though you favor not that profession. It is
reported of the <i>Camelion</i> that shee can chaunge her selfe unto all
coollors save whyte, and you can accompte of all thinges save such as
have honesty. <i>Plutarch</i> your good Mayster may bare me witness that
the ende whereto Musick was, will proove it prayes worthy. O Lord
howe maketh it a man to remember heavenly things to wo[n]der at the
works of the creator. <i>Eloquence</i> can stay the souldiars sworde from
slayinge an Orator, and shall not musike be magnified which not onely
saveth the bodye but is a comfort to the soule? David rejoyseth singeth
and prayeth the Lorde by the Harpe, and the Simbale is not removed
from his sanctuary, the Aungels syng <i>gloria in excelsis</i>. Surely the
imagination in this present instant calleth me to a deepe consideration
of my God. Looke for wonders where musike worketh, and wher harmonie is
ther followeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> increcible delectation. The bowels of the earth y[i]eld
where the instrument soundeth and <i>Pluto</i> cannot keepe <i>Proserpina</i>
if <i>Orpheus</i> recorde. The Seas shall not swallowe <i>Arion</i> whilst he
singeth, nether shall hee perish while he harpeth, a doleful tuner yf
a diing musition can move a Monster of ye sea to mourne. A Dolphin
respectet a heavenly recorde.</p>

<p>Call your selfe home therefore and reclayme thys follye, it is to[o]
foule to bee admitted, you may not mayntaine it. I hadd well hoped
you woulde in all these thynges have wiselye admytted the thyng, and
disalowe naughte but the abus, but I see your mynde in youre wrytinge
was to penn somewhat you knowe not what, and to confyrme it I wot not
howe, so that yourselfe hath hatched us an Egge yet so that it hath
blest us wyth a monsterus chickin, both wythoute hedde, and also tayle,
lyke the Father, full of imperfection and lesse zeale. Well marke yet
a lyttle more, beare with me though I be bytter, my love is never the
lesse for that I have learned of <i>Tullye</i>, that <i>Nulla remedia tam
faciunt dolorem quam quæ sunt salutaria</i>, the sharper medycine the
better it cures, the more you see your follye, the sooner may you amend
it. Are not the straines in Musike to tickle and delyght the eare?
are not our warlike instruments to move men to valor? you confesse
they moove us, but yet they delight not our eares? I pray you whence
grew that poynt of Phylosophy? It is more then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> ever my Mayster taught
mee, that a thynge of sounde shoulde not delyghte the eare. Belyke yee
suppose that men are monsters, withoute eares, or else I thynke you
wyll saye they heare with theire heeles, it may bee so; for indeede
when wee are delighted with Musike, it maketh our heart to scypp for
joye, and it maye bee perhaps by assending from the heele to the hygher
partes, it may move us, good policie in sooth, this was of your owne
coyning, your mother never taught it you, but I wyll not deale by
reason of philosophye wyth you for that confound your senses, but I can
asure you this one thinge, that this principle will make the wiser to
mislike your invention, it had bene a fitter jest for your howlet in
your playe, then an orname[n]t in your booke. But since you wrote of
abuses, we may licence you to lye a little, so ye abuse will be more
manifest. Lord with how goodly a cote have you clothed your conceiptes,
you abound in storyes but impertinent, they bewray your reeding but
not your wisedom, would God they had bin well aplyed. But now I must
play the musitian right nolesse buggs now come in place but pavions
and mesures, dumps and fancies, and here growes a great question what
musick <i>Homer</i> used in curing ye diseased gretians, it was no dump
you say, and so think I, for yt is not apliable to sick men, for it
favoreth Malancholie. I am sure it was no mesure, for in those days
they were not such good da[n]sers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> for so[o]th the[n] what was it? If
you require me, if you name me the instrume[n]t, I wyl tel you what
was ye musik. Meanwhile a gods name let us both dout yt is no part of
our salvation to know what it was nor how it went. When I speak with
<i>Homer</i> next you shall knowe his answere.</p>

<p>But you can not be content to erre but you must maintain it to[o].
<i>Pithagoras</i> you say alowes not that musik is decerned by eares, but
hee wisheth us to assend unto the sky and marke that harmony. Surely
this is but one doctors opinion (yet I dislike not of it) but to speake
my conscience my thinkes musike best pleaseth me when I heare it, for
otherwise the catter walling of Cats, were it not for harmonie, should
more delight mine eies then the tunable voyces of men. But these things
are not the chiefest poynts you shote at, thers somewhat els sticketh
in your stomak God graunt it hurt you not, from the daunce you runn
to the pype from 7. to 3. which if I shoulde add I beleeve I could
wrest out halfe a score inco[n]veniences more out of your booke. Our
pleasant consortes do discomfort you much, and because you lyke not
thereof they arr discomendable, I have heard it is good to take sure
fotinge when we travel unknowen countryes, for when we wade above our
shoe latchet <i>Appelles</i> wyll reprehende us for coblers, if you had bene
a father in musick and coulde have decerned of tunes I would perhaps
have likt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> your opinion sumwhat where now I abhor it, if you wear a
professor of that practise I would quickly perswade you, that the
adding of strings to our instrument make the sound more hermonious, and
that the mixture of Musike maketh a better concent. But to preach to
unskillfull is to perswad ye brut beastes, I wyl not stand long in thys
point although the dignitye thereof require a volume, but howe learned
men have esteemed this heavenly gift, if you please to read you shall
see. <i>Socrates</i> in hys old age will not disdain to learn ye science of
Music amo[n]g children, he can abide their correctio[n]s to[o], so much
accou[n]ted he that wt you contemn, so profitable thought he yt, wt you
mislik. <i>Solon</i> wil esteme so much of ye knowledg of singing, yt he
wil soner forget to dye the[n] to sing. <i>Pithagoras</i> liks it so wel yt
he wil place it in <i>Greace</i>, and <i>Aristoxenus</i> will saye yt the soule
is musik. <i>Plato</i> (in his booke <i>de legibus</i>) will affirme that it can
not be handled without all sciences, the <i>Lacedemonians and Cretensis</i>
wer sturred to warre by Anapæstus foote, and <i>Timotheus</i> with the same
incensed kinge <i>Alexander</i> to batel, ye yf <i>Boetyus</i> fitten not, on
<i>Tauromitanus</i> (by this <i>Phrigian</i> sound) hastened to burn a house wher
a stru[m]pet was hidden.</p>

<p>So little abideth this heave[n]ly harmony our humane filthines yt it
worketh wonders as you may perceve most manifestly by the history of
<i>Agamemnon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> who going to ye Trojan war, left at home a musitian yt
playde the <i>Dorian</i> tune, who wt the foote <i>Spondeus</i> preserved his
wife <i>Clitemnestra</i> in chastity and honesty, wherfore she co[u]ld not
be deflowred by <i>Ægistus</i>, before he had wickedly slain the musitian.
So yt as the magnetes draweth Iorne, and the Theamides (w<sup>c</sup> groweth
in <i>Ægipt</i>) driveth it away: so musik calleth to it selfe al honest
plesures, and dispelleth fro[m] it all vaine misdemanors. Yt matter
is so ple[n]tiful that I cannot find wher to end, as for beginnings
they be infinite, but these shall suffice. I like not to[o] long
circu[m]stances wher les doe serve: only I wish you to accompt wel
of this heave[n]ly concent, w<sup>c</sup> is ful of perfettio[n], preceding
fro[m] above, drawing his original fro[m] the motion of ye stars,
fro[m] the agrement of the planets, fro[m] the whisteling winds, and
fro[m] al those celestial circles where is e[i]ther perfit agreeme[n]t
or any <i>Sumphonia</i>. But as I like musik so admit I not of thos that
deprave the same: your pipers are as odius to mee as yourselfe; nether
alowe I your harpinge merye beggers: although I knewe you my selfe a
professed play maker, and a paltry actor. Since which ye windmil of
your wit hath bin tornd so long wyth the wynde of folly, that I fear
me we shall see the dogg returne to his vomit, and the clensed sow
to her myre, and the reformed scholemayster to hys old teaching of
follye. Beware it be not so, let not your booke be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> a blemish to your
own profession. Correct not musik therfore whe[n] it is praiesworthy,
least your worthlesse misliking bewray your madnes. Way the abuse and
that is matter sufficient to serve a magistrates animadversion. Heere
may you advise well, and if you have any stale rethorik florish upon
thys text, the abuse is, when that is applyed to wantonnesse, which
was created to shewe Gods worthinesse. When ye shamefull resorts of
shameles curtezanes in sinful sonnets shall prophane vertue, these
are no light sinnes, these make many good men lament, this causeth
parents hate there right borne children, if this were reformed by your
policie I should esteme of you as you wysh. I feare me it fareth far
otherwyse, <i>latet anguis in herba</i>, under your fare show of conscience
take heede you cloake not your abuse, it were pittie the learned should
be overseene in your simplenesse, I feare me you will be politick wyth
<i>Machavel</i> not zealous as a prophet. Well I will not stay long upon the
abuse, for that I see it is to[o] manifest, the remembraunce thereof
is discommendable among the godly, and I my self am very loth to bring
it in memory. To the wise advised reader these mai suffice, to flee
the <i>Crocodel</i> before he commeth, lest we be bitten, and to avoyde the
abuse of musik, since we se[e] it, lest our misery be more when we
fall into folly. <i>Ictus piscator sapit</i>, you heare open confession,
these abuses are disclaimed by our Gosson, he is sory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> that hee hath
so leudlye lived, and spent the oyle of his perfection in unsavery
Lampes. He hath <i>Argus</i> eyes to watch him now, I wold wish him beware
of his Islington, and such lyke resorts, if now he retourne from his
repented lyfe to his old folly, Lord how foule will be his fall. Men
know more then they speak if they be wise, I feare me some will blush
that readeth this, if he be bitten, wold God Gosson at that instant
might have a watchman. But I see it were needelesse, perhaps he hath
<i>Os durum</i>, and then what avayleth their presence.</p>

<p>Well, I leave this poynt til I know further of your mynde, mean while I
must talke a little wyth you about ye thyrd abuse, for the cater cosens
of pypers, theyr names (as you terme them) be players, and I think as
you doe, for your experience is sufficient to enforme me. But here I
must loke about me, <i>quacunque tetigeris ulcus est</i>, here is a task
that requireth a long treatis, and what my opinion is of players ye now
shall plainly perceve. I must now serch my wits, I see this shall passe
throughe many severe sensors handling, I must advise me what I write,
and write that I would wysh. I way wel the seriousnes of the cause, and
regarde very much the Judges of my endevor, whom if I could I would
perswade that I woulde not nourish abuse, nether mayntaine that which
should be an universall discomoditye. I hope they wil not judge before
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> read, nether condemne without occasion. The wisest wil alwais
carry to eares, in yt they are to diserne two indifferent causes. I
meane not to hold you in suspe[n]c[e] (severe Judges) if you gredely
expect my verdit brefely this it is.</p>

<p><i>Demostines</i> thoughte not that <i>Phillip</i> shoulde overcome when he
reproved hym, nether feared <i>Cicero Anthonies</i> force when in the
Senatt hee rebuked hym. To the ignorant e[a]ch thinge that is unknowne
semes unprofitable, but a wise man can foresee and prayse by proofe.
<i>Pythagoras</i> could spy oute in womens eyes two kind of teares, the one
of grefe the other of disceit: and those of judgement can from the
same flower suck honey with the bee, from whence the Spyder (I mean
the ignorant) take their poison. Men yt have knowledge what comedies
and tragedis be, wil comend the[m], but it is sufferable in the folish
to reprove that they know not, becaus ther mouthes wil hardly be
stopped. Firste therfore, if it be not tedious to Gosson to harken
to the lerned, the reder shall perceive the antiquity of playmaking,
the inventors of comedies, and therewithall the use and comoditaye
of the[m]. So that in ye end I hope my labor shall be liked, and the
learned wil soner conceve his folly.</p>

<p>For tragedies and comedies <i>Donate</i> the gramarian sayth, they wer
invented by lerned fathers of the old time to no other purpose, but
to yeelde prayse unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> God for a happy harvest, or plentifull yeere,
and that thys is trewe the name of Tragedye doeth importe, for if
you consider whence it came, you shall perceive (as <i>Iodocus Badius</i>
reporteth) that it drewe his original of <i>Tragos, Hircus</i>, and <i>Ode,
Cantus</i> (so called), for that the actors thereof had in rewarde for
theyr labour, a Gotes skynne fylled wyth wyne. You see then that
the fyrste matter of tragedies was to give thankes and prayses to
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and a gratefull prayer of the countrymen for a happye
harvest, and this I hope was not discommendable. I knowe you will
judge [th]is farthest from abuse. But to wade farther, thys fourme of
invention being found out, as the dayes wherein it was used did decay,
and the world grew to more perfection, so yt witt of the younger sorte
became more riper, for they leaving this fourme, invented an other,
in the which they altered the nature but not ye name: for sounets
in prayse of ye gods, they did set forth the sower fortune of many
exiles, the miserable fal of haples princes, the reuinous decay of
many cou[n]tryes, yet not content with this, they presented the lives
of <i>Satyers</i>, so that they might wiselye, under the abuse of that
name, discover the follies of many theyr folish fellow-citesens: and
those monsters were then, as our parasites are now adayes: suche as
with pleasure reprehended abuse. As for commedies because they bear a
more plesanter vain, I wil leave the other to speake of them. <i>Tully</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
defines them thus. <i>Comedia</i> (sayth he) is <i>Imitatio vitæ, speculum
consuetudinis, et imago veritatis</i>, and it is sayde to be termed of
<i>Comai</i> (emongste the Greekes) whiche signifieth <i>Pagos</i>, and <i>Ode,
Cantus</i>: for that they were exercised in the fielde. They had they
beginning wyth tragedies, but their matter was more plessaunt, for they
were suche as did reprehend, yet <i>quodam lepore</i>. These first very
rudely were invented by <i>Susarion Bullus</i>, and <i>Magnes</i> t[w]o auncient
poets, yet so that they were mervelous profitable to the reclamynge of
abuse: whereupon <i>Eupolis</i> with <i>Cratinus</i>, and <i>Aristophanes</i> began
to write, and with ther eloquenter vaine and perfection of stil[e],
dyd more severely speak agaynst the abuses the[n] they: which <i>Horace</i>
himselfe witnesseth. For sayth he ther was no abuse but these men
reprehended it. A thefe was loth to be seene on there spectacle. A
coward was never present at theyr assemblies. A backbiter abhord
that company, and I my self could not have blamed your (Gosson) for
exempting yourselfe from this theater, of troth I should have lykt your
pollicy. These therefore, these wer they that kept men in awe, these
restrayned the unbridled cominaltie, whereupon <i>Horace</i> wisely sayeth,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Oderunt peccare boni, virtutis amore,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oderunt peccare mali, formidine penæ.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The good did hate al sinne for vertues love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bad for feare of shame did sin remove.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>Yea would God our realme could light uppon a <i>Lucillius</i>, then should
the wicked bee poynted out from the good, a harlot woulde seeke no
harbor at stage plais, lest she shold here her owne name growe in
question: and the discourse of her honesty cause her to bee hated of
the godly. As for you I am sure of this one thing, he would paint you
in your players orname[n]ts, for they best becam you. But as these
sharpe corrections were disanulde in Rome when they grewe to more
licenciousnes: so I fear me if we shold practise it in our dayes,
the same intertainmente would followe. But in illreformed Rome what
comedies now? A poets wit can correct, yet not offend. <i>Philemon</i>
will mitigate the corrections of sinne, by reproving them covertly in
shadowes. <i>Menandar</i> dare not offend ye Senate openly, yet wants he not
a parasite to touch them prively. <i>Terence</i> wyl not report the abuse
of harlots under there proper stile, but he can finely girde the[m]
under the person of <i>Thais</i>. Hee dare not openly tell the Rich of theyr
covetousnesse and severity towards their children, but he can controle
them under the person of <i>Durus Demeas</i>. He must not shew the abuse of
noble yong gentilmen under theyr owne title, but he wyll warne them in
the person of <i>Pamphilus</i>. Wil you learne to know a parasite? Looke
upon his <i>Dauus</i>. Wyl you seke the abuse of courtly flatterers? Behold
<i>Gnato</i>: and if we had some Satericall Poetes nowe a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> dayes to penn
our commedies, that might be admitted of zeale to discypher the abuses
of the worlde in the person of notorious offenders. I know we should
wisely ryd our assemblyes of many of your brotherhod, but because
you may have a full scope to reprehende, I will ryp up a rableme[n]t
of playmakers, whose wrightinges I would wishe you overlooke, and
seeke out theyr abuses. Can you mislike of <i>Cecillius</i>? or dispise
<i>Plinius</i>? or amend <i>Neuius</i>? or find fault with <i>Licinius</i>? Wherein
offended <i>Actilius</i>? I am sure you can not but wonder at <i>Terrence</i>?
Wil it please you to like of <i>Turpelius</i>? or alow of <i>Trabea</i>? You
muste needs make much of <i>Ennius</i> for overloke al thes, and you shal
find ther volums ful of wit if you examine the[m]: so yt if you had no
other masters, you might deserve to be a doctor, wher now you are but a
folishe scholemaister. But I wyll deale wyth you verye freendlye, I wil
resolve everi doubt that you find. Those instrumentes which you mislike
in playes grow of auncient custome, for when <i>Rossius</i> was an Actor,
be sure that as with his tears he moved affections, so the Musitian in
the Theater before the entrance, did mornefully record it in melody
(as Servius reporteth). The actors in Rome had also gay clothing and
every ma[n]s aparel was apliable to his part and person. The old men
in white, ye rich men in purple, the parasite disguisedly, the yong
men in gorgeous coulours, ther wanted no devise nor good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> judgeme[n]t
of ye comedy, whe[n]c[e] I suppose our players both drew ther plaies
and fourme of garments. As for the appointed dayes wherin comedies wer
showen, I reede that the Romaynes appoynted them on the festival dayes,
in such reputation were they had at that time. Also <i>Iodocus Badius</i>
will assertain you that the actors for shewing pleasure receved some
profite. But let me apply those dayes to ours, their actors to our
players, their autors to ours.</p>

<p>Surely we want not a <i>Rossius</i>, nether ar ther great scarsity of
<i>Terrences</i> professio[n], but yet our men dare not nowe a dayes presume
so much as the old Poets might, and therfore they apply ther writing
to the peoples vain, wheras if in the beginning they had ruled, we
should now adaies have found smal spectacles of folly. But (of truth)
I must confes with <i>Aristotle</i>, that men are greatly delighted with
imitation, and that it were good to bring those things on stage, that
were altogether tending to vertue: all this I admit, and hartely wysh,
but you say unlesse the thinge be taken away the vice will continue,
nay I say if the style were changed the practise would profit. And
sure I thinke our theaters fit, that <i>Ennius</i> seeing our wa[n]ton
<i>Glicerium</i> may rebuke her, if our poetes will nowe become severe, and
for prophane things write of vertue: you I hope shoulde see a reformed
state in those thinges, which I feare me yf they were not, the idle
hedded commones would worke more mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>chiefe. I wish as zealously as the
best that all abuse of playinge were abolished, but for the thing, the
antiquitie causeth me to allow it, so it be used as it should be. I
cannot allow the prophaning of the Sabaoth, I praise your reprehension
in that, you did well in discommending the abuse, and surely I wysh
that that folly wer disclaymed, it is not to be admitted, it maks
those sinne, which perhaps if it were not, would have binne present at
a good sermon. It is in the Magistrate to take away that order, and
appoynt it otherwyse. But sure it were pittie to abolish yt which hath
so great vertue in it, because it is abused. The Germanes when the
use of preaching was forbidden them, what helpe had they I pray you?
Forsoth the learned were fayne covertly in comodies to declare abuses,
and by playing to incite the people to vertues, whe[n] they might heare
no preaching. Those were lamentable dayes you will say, and so thinke
I, but was not this I pray you a good help in reforming the decaying
Gospel? You see then how comedies (my severe judges) are requesit both
for ther antiquity, and for ther commoditye: for the dignity of the
wrighters, and the pleasure of the hearers. But after your discrediting
of playmaking, you salve uppon the sore somewhat, and among many wise
workes there be some that fitte your vaine: the practise of parasites
is one, which I mervel it likes you so well since it bites you so sore.
But sure in that I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> your judgement, and for the rest to[o], I
approve your wit, but for the pigg of your own sow (as you terme it)
assuredly I must discommend your verdit. Tell me Gosson was all your
owne you wrote there: did you borow nothing of your neyghbours? but of
what booke patched you out <i>Ciceros</i> oration? Whence fet you <i>Catulins</i>
invective? Thys is one thing, <i>alienam olet lucernâ non tuam</i>. So that
your helper may wisely reply upon you with <i>Virgil</i>,</p>

it is a poynt of folly to praise without deserte. You dislike players
very much, theyr dealings be not for your commodity, whom if I myghte

<p>Methinks I heare some of them verifiing these verses upon you, if
it so be that I hear them, I wil concele it, as for the statute of
apparrell and the abuses thereof, I see it manifestly broken, and if
I should seeke for example, you cannot but offend my eyes. For if
you examine the statuts exactly, a simple cote should be fitted to
your backe. We should bereve you of your braverye, and examine your
au[n]cestry, and by profession in respect of ye statute, we should find
you catercosens with a (but hush), you know my meaning, I must for
pitie favor your credit in that you weare once a scholler. You runne
farther to Carders, dicers, fencers, bowlers, dauncers, and tomblers,
whose abuses I wold rebuke with you, had not your self moved other
matters. But to eche I say thus, for dicing I wyshe those that know it
not to leave to learn it, and let the fall of others make them wiser.
Yf they had an <i>Alexander</i> to govern they shold be punished, and I
could wish them not to abuse the lenitie of their prince. <i>Cicero</i> for
a great blemish reputeth that which our gentilmen use for bravery,
but <i>sufficit ista leniter attigisse</i>, a word against fencers, and so
an end. Whom I wish to beware with <i>Demonax</i> lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> admitting theyr
fencing delightes, they destroy (with the <i>Athenians</i>) the alters of
peace; by raysing quarrellous causes, they worke uprores: but you
and I reprove the[m] in abuse, yet I (for my part) cannot but allow
the practise so it be well used. As for the filling of our gracious
princes cofers with peace, as it pertaineth not to me, because I am
none of her receivors, so men think unlesse it hath bine lately you
have not bene of her majesties counsel. But now here as you begin
folishly, so surely you end unlernedly. Prefer you warre before peace?
the sword before the Goune? the rule of a Tyrant before ye happy days
of our gracious Queen? You know the philosophers are against you, yet
dare you stand in handy grips wyth <i>Cicero</i>: you know that force is
but an instrume[n]t when counsell fayleth, and if wisedome win not,
farwel warre. Aske <i>Alphonsus</i> what counsellors he lyketh of? hee will
say his bookes: and hath not I pray you pollicy alwais over-mastered
force? Who subdued <i>Hannibal</i> in his great royalty? he yt durst
knock at Rome gates to have the[m] opened is nowe become a pray to a
sylly senator. <i>Appius Claudius et senex et c&aelig;cus</i>, a father full of wisedome
can releve the state of decaying Rome. And was it force that subdued
<i>Marius</i>? or armes that discovered <i>Catulins</i> conspiracies? Was it rash
reuendg in punishing <i>Cethegus</i>? or want of witt in the discoverye
of treason? <i>Cato</i> can correct him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>selfe for traveling by Sea, when
the land profereth passage, or to be fole hardy in over mutch hazard.
<i>Aristotle</i> accompteth counsell holye, and <i>Socrates</i> can terme it the
key of certentye. What shall we count of war but wrath, of battel but
hastines, and if I did rule (with <i>Augustus Cæsar</i>) I woulde refuse
these counselers. What made ye oracle I praye you accompt of <i>Calchas</i>
so much? was it not for his wisedome? who doth not like of the governer
that had rather meete with <i>Unum Nestorem</i> than <i>decem Aiaces</i>? You
cannot tame a Lyon but in tyme, neither a Tigres in few dayes. Counsell
in <i>Regulus</i> will preferring the liberty of his country before his

shall flesh himselfe on an olde mans carkas, whose wisedom preserved

your wits, as shal make th&#275; ranckle till you become fooles. Nay,
if you shoot bookes like fooles bolts, Ile be so bold as to make your
iudgements quiuer with my thunderbolts. If you meane to gather clowdes
in the Commonwealth, to threaten tempests, for your flakes of snowe
weele pay you with stones of hayle; if with an Easterlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> winde you

<p class="ph4">TO THE INDIFFERENT READER.</p>

<p>It is high time to search in what corner of the Church the fire
is kindled, being crept so far, as that with the verie smoke the
consciences of diuers are smothered. It is found that certaine Martins,
if no miscreants in religion (which wee may suspect) yet without
doubt malec&#333;tents (which wee ought to feare) haue throwen fire,
not into the Church porch, but into the Chauncell, and though not
able by learning and iudgement to displace a Sexton, yet seeke to
remooue Bishops. They haue scattered diuers libels, all so taunting and
slanderous, as it is hard to iudge, whether their lyes exceed their
bitternesse, or their bitternesse their fables.</p>

<p>If they be answered by the grauitie of learned Prelates, they
presentlie reply with railings; which argueth their intent to be as
farre fr&#333; the truth of deuotion, as their writings from mildnes of
spirit. It is said that camels neuer drinke, till they haue troubled
the water with their feete, and it seemes these Martins cannot carouse
the sapp of the Church, till by faction they make tumults in religion.
Seeing th&#275; either they expect no graue replie, or that they are
settled with railing to replie; I thought it more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> conuenient, to giue
them a whisk with their owne wand, than to haue them spurd with deeper
learning.</p>

<p>The Scithian slaues, though they bee vp in armes, must bee tamde with
whippes, not swords, and these mutiners in Church matters, must haue
their mouthes bungd with iests, not arguments.</p>

<p>I seldome vse to write, and yet neuer writ anie thing, that in speech
might seeme vndecent, or in sense vnhonest; if here I haue vsed bad
tearmes, it is because they are not to bee answered with good tearmes:
for whatsoeuer shall seeme lauish in this Pamphlet, let it be thought
borrowed of Martins language. These Martins were hatcht of addle egges,
els could they not haue such idle heads. They measure conscience by
their owne yard, and like the theeues, that had an yron bed, in which
all that were too long they would cut euen, all that were too short
they would stretch out, and none escapte vnrackt or vnsawed, that were
not iust of their beds length: so all that are not Martins, that is,
of their peeuish mind, must be measured by them. If he come short of
their religion, why he is but a colde Protestant, hee must bee pluckt
out to the length of a Puritane. If any be more deuout than they are,
as to giue almes, fast, and pray, then they cut him off close by the
workes, and say he is a Papist. If one be not cast in Martins mould,
his religion must needes mould. He saith he is a Courtier, I thinke
no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> Courtier so peruerse, that seeing the streight rule of the Church,
would goe about to bend it. It may be he is some Iester about the
Court, and of that I meruaile, because I know all the fooles there, and
yet cannot gesse at him. What euer he be, if his conscience be pind to
his cognizance, I will account him more politicke than religious, and
more dangerous for ciuill broyles, than the Spaniard for an open warre.
I am ignorant of Martin and his maintainer, but my conscience is my
warrant, to care for neither. For I knowe there is none of honour so
carelesse, nor any in zeale so peeuish, nor of nature any so barbarous,
that wil succour those that be suckers of the Church, a thing against
God and policie; against God, in subuerting religion; against policie,
in altering gouernment, making in the Church the feast of the
Lapithees, where all shall bee throwne on anothers head, because euerie
one would be the head. And these it is high time to tread vnder foote:
for who would not make a threshold of those, that go about to make the
Church a barne to thresh in. <i>Itaque sic disputo.</i></p>

<p class="ph4">PAPPE WITH AN HATCHET</p>

<p>Good morrow, goodman Martin, good morrow: will ye anie musique this
morning? What, fast a sleepe? Nay faith, Ile cramp thee till I wake
thee. <i>O whose tat?</i> Nay gesse olde knaue and odd knaue: for Ile neuer
leaue pulling, till I haue thee out of thy bed into the streete; and
then all shall see who thou art, and thou know what I am.</p>

<p>Your Knaueship brake you fast on the Bishops, by breaking your iests
on them: but take heed you breake not your owne necke. Bastard Iunior
dinde vpon them, and cramde his maw as full of mallice, as his head was
of malapertnesse. Bastard Senior was with them at supper, and I thinke
tooke a surfet of colde and raw quipps. O what queasie girds were they
towards the fall of the leafe. Old Martin, neuer entaile thy wit to the
eldest, for hee'le spend all he hath in a quire of paper.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hee sweares by his mazer, that he will make their wits
wetshod, if the ale haue his swift current.</i></div>

<p>Now sirs, knowing your bellies full of Bishops bobbs, I am sure your
bones would be at rest: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> wee'le set vp all our rests, to make
you all restie. I was once determined to write a proper newe Ballet,
entituled <i>Martin and his Maukin</i>, to no tune, because Martin was out
of all tune. Elderton swore hee had rimes lying a steepe in ale, which
should marre all your reasons: there is an olde hacker that shall take
order for to print them. O how hee'le cut it, when his ballets come out
of the lungs of the licour. They shall be better than those of Bonner,
or the ierkes for a Iesuit. The first begins, Come tit me come tat me,
come throw a halter at me.</p>

<p>Then I thought to touch Martin with Logick, but there was a little wag
in Cambridge, that swore by Saint Seaton, he would so swinge him with
Sillogismes, that all Martins answeres should ake. The vile boy hath
manie bobbes, and a whole fardle of fallacies. He begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Linquo coax ranis, cros coruis, vanaque vanis.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ad Logicam pergo, quæ Mart'ins non timet ergo.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And saies, he will ergo Martin into an ague. I haue read but one of his
arguments.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tiburne stands in the cold,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But Martins are a warme furre;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Therefore Tiburne must be furd with Martins.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>O (quoth I) boy thou wilt be shamed; tis neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> in moode nor figure:
all the better, for I am in a moode to cast a figure, that shall bring
them to the conclusion. I laught at the boye, and left him drawing all
the lines of Martin into sillogismes, euerie conclusion beeing this,
Ergo Martin is to bee hangd.</p>

<p>Nay, if rime and reason bee both forestalde, Ile raile, if Martin haue
not barrelde vp all rakehell words: if he haue, what care I to knock
him on the head with his owne hatchet. He hath taken vp all the words
for his obscenitie: obscentie? Nay, now I am too nice; squirrilitie
were a better word: well, let me alone to squirrell them.</p>

<p>Martin, thinkst thou, thou hast so good a wit, as none can outwrangle
thee? Yes Martin, wee will play three a vies wits: art thou so backt
that none dare blade it with thee? Yes Martin, wee will drop vie
stabbes. Martin sweares I am some gamester. Why, is not gaming lawful?
I know where there is more play in the compasse of an Hospitall,
than in the circuite of Westchester. One hath been an old stabber
at passage: the One that I meane, thrust a knife into ones thigh at
Cambridge, the quarrel was about cater-tray, and euer since he hath
quarrelled about cater-caps.</p>

<p>I thought that hee which thrust at the bodie in game, would one daie
cast a foyne at the soule in earnest. But hee workes closelie and
sees all, hee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> learnd that of old Vydgin the cobler, who wrought ten
yeares with spectacles, and yet swore he could see through a dicker of
leather. He hath a wanton spleene, but wee will haue it stroakt with
a spurne, because his eies are bleard, he thinkes to bleare all ours;
but let him take this for a warning, or else looke for such a warming,
as shall make all his deuices as like wood, as his spittle is like
woodsere. Take away the Sacke, and giue him some Cinamom water, his
conscience hath a colde stomacke. Cold? Thou art deceiued, twil digest
a Cathedral Church as easilie as an Estritch a two penie naile.</p>

<p>But softe Martins, did your Father die at the Groyne? It was well
groapt at, for I knewe him sicke of a paine in the groyne. A pockes of
that religion (quoth Iulian Grimes to her Father) when al his haires
fell off on the sodaine. Well let the olde knaue be dead. Whie are not
the spawnes of such a dog-fish hangd? Hang a spawne? drowne it; alls
one, damne it.</p>

<p>Ye like not a Bishops rochet, when all your fathers hankerchers were
made of his sweete harts smocke. That made you bastards, and your dad
a cuckold, whose head is swolne so big, that he had neede sende to the
cooper to make him a biggin: and now you talke of a cooper, Ile tell
you a tale of a tubb.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>They are not so many, thei are all Centimani, an hundred
hands a peece: so that in all they are but one thousand.</i></div>

<p>At Sudburie, where the Martin-m&#333;gers swarmd to a lecture, like
beares to a honnie pot: a good honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> strippling, of the age of
fiftie yeares or thereabout, that could haue done a worse act if
companie had not been neere, askt his sweete sister, whether lecherie
in her conscience were a sinne? In faith (quoth she) I thinke it the
superficies of sinne, and no harme if the tearmes be not abusde, for
you must say, vertuously done, not lustily done. Fie, this is filthie
ribaldry. O sir, ther is no mirth without ribaldrie, nor ribaldrie
without Martin, ask mine hostesse of the iuie bush in Wye for the one,
and my old hostesse of the Swanne in Warwicke for the other. She is
dead: the diuell she is. You are too broad with Martins brood: for hee
hath a hundred thousand that will set their handes to his Articles, and
shewe the Queene. Sweeter and sweeter: for wee haue twentie hundred
thousand handes to withstand them. I would it were come to the grasp,
we would show them an Irish tricke, that when they thinke to winne
the game with one man, wee'le make holde out till wee haue but two
left to carrie them to the gallowes: well followed in faith, for thou
saidst thou wert a gamester. All this is but bad English, when wilt
thou come to a stile? Martin hath manie good words. Manie? Now you
put me in minde of the matter, there is a booke c&#333;ming out of a
hundred merrie tales, and the petigree of Martin, fetchte from the
burning of Sodome, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> armes shal be set on his hearse, for we are
prouiding his funerall, and for the winter nights the tales shall be
told <i>secundum vsum Sarum</i>: the Deane of Salisburie can tell twentie.
If this will not make Martin mad, malicious and melancholie (ô braue
letter followed with a full crie) then will we be desperate, and hire
one that shall so translate you out of French into English, that you
will blush and lie by it. And one will we coniure vp, that writing
a familiar Epistle about the naturall causes of an Earthquake, fell
into the bowells of libelling, which made his eares quake for feare of
clipping, he shall tickle you with taunts; all his works bound close,
are at least sixe sheetes in quarto, and he calls them the first tome
of his familiar Epistle: he is full of latin endes, and worth tenne
of those that crie in London, <i>haie ye anie gold ends to sell</i>. If
he giue you a bob, though he drawe no bloud, yet are you sure of a
rap with a bable. If he ioyne with vs, <i>perijsti</i> Martin, thy wit wil
be massacred: if the toy take him to close with thee, then haue I my
wish, for this tenne yeres haue I lookt to lambacke him. Nay he is a
mad lad, and such a one as cares as little for writing without wit, as
Martin doth for writing without honestie; a notable coach companion for
Martin, to drawe Diuinitie from the Colledges of Oxford and Cambridge,
to Shoomakers hall in Sainct Martins. But we neither feare Martin, nor
the foot-cloth, nor the beast that wears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> it, be he horse or asse;
nor whose sonne he is, be he Martins sonne, Iohns sonne, or Richards
sonne; nor of what occupation he be, be a ship-wright, cart-wright, or
tiburn-wright. If they bring seuen hundred men, they shall be boxt with
fourteen hundred boyes. Nay we are growing to a secret bargaine. O,
but I forgate a riddle; <i>the more it is spied, the lesse it is seene</i>.
Thats the Sunne: the lesse it is spied of vs, the more it is seene of
those vnder vs. The Sunne? thou art an asse, it is the Father, for the
old knaue, thinking by his bastardie to couer his owne heade, putteth
it like a stagge ouer the pale. Pale? nay I will make him blush as red
as ones nose, that was alwaies washt in well water.</p>

<p>What newes from the Heraldes? Tush, thats time enough to know to
morrow, for the sermon is not yet cast. The sermon foole? why they
neuer studie, but cleaue to Christ his <i>dabitur in illa hora</i>. They
venter to catch soules, as they were soles; Doctors are but dunces,
none sowes true stitches in a pulpet, but a shoomaker.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Martin Iunior saies, hee found his fathers papers vnder a
bush, the knaue was started from his Fourme.</i></div>

<p>Faith, thou wilt bee caught by the stile. What care I to be found by
a stile, when so many Martins haue been taken vnder an hedge? If they
cannot leuell, they will roue at thee, and anatomize thy life from the
cradle to the graue, and thy bodie from the corne on thy toe, to the
crochet on thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> head. They bee as cunning in cutting vp an honest mans
credit, as Bull in quartering a knaues bodie. Tush (what care I) is my
posie; if hee meddle with mee, Ile make his braines so hot that they
shall crumble, and rattle in his warpt scull, like pepper in a dride
bladder.</p>

<p>I haue a catalogue of al the sheepe, and it shall go hard, but I will
crosse the bel-weather. Why shuld I feare him that walkes on his
neats-feete. Neither court, nor countrie that shal be free, I am like
death, Ile spare none. There shall not misse a name of anie, that had a
Godfather; if anie bee vnchristened, Ile nicke him with a name.</p>

<p>But whist; beware an action of the case. Then put this for the case,
whether it bee not as lawfull to set downe the facts of knaues, as
for a knaue to slander honest men. Alls as it is taken; marie the
diuell take al, if truth find not as many soft cushions to leane on as
trecherie.</p>

<p>Theres one with a lame wit, which will not weare a foure cornerd cap,
then let him put on Tiburne, that hath but three corners; and yet the
knaue himselfe hath a pretie wench in euerie corner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>He calls none but the heavens to witnesse.</i></div>

<p>I could tickle Martin with a true tale of one of his sonnes, that
hauing the companie of one of his sisters in the open fieldes, saide,
hee would not smoother vp sinne, and deale in hugger mugger against
his Conscience. In the hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> merrie tales, the places, the times,
the witnesses and all, shall be put downe to the proofe, where I
warrant you, the Martinists haue consciences of proofe. Doost think
Martin, thou canst not be discouered? What foole would not thinke him
discouered that is balde? Put on your night cap, and your holie day
English, and the best wit you haue for high daies, all wil be little
enough to keep you from a knaues penance, though as yet you bee in a
fooles paradice. If you coyen words, as <i>Cankerburie</i>, <i>Canterburines</i>,
etc. whie, I know a foole that shall so inkhornize you with straunge
phrases, that you shall blush at your owne bodges. For Similes, theres
another shal liken thee to anie thing, besides he can raile too. If
Martin muzzle not his mouth, and manacle his hands, Ile blabb all, and
not sticke to tell, that pewes and stewes are rime in their religion.</p>

<p>Scratch not thy head Martin, for be thou Martin the bird, or Martin the
beast; a bird with the longest bill, or a beast with the longest eares,
theres a net spread for your necke. Martin, Ile tell thee a tale woorth
twelue pence, if thy witt bee woorth a pennie.</p>

<p>There came to a Duke in Italie, a large lubber and a beggerlie, saying
hee had the Philosophers Stone, and that hee could make golde faster
than the Duke could spend it. The Duke askt him why hee made none to
mainteine himself? Because, quoth he, I could neuer get a secret place
to worke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> in; for once I endeuoured, and the Popes holinesse sent for
me, whom if he had caught, I should haue been a prentice to mainteine
his pride. The Duke minding to make triall of his cunning, and eager
of golde, set him to worke closely in a vault, where it was not knowen
to his neerest seruants. This Alcumist, in short time consumed two
thousande pound of the Dukes gold, and brought him halfe a ducket: whie
(quoth the Duke) is this all? All, quoth he, my Lord, that I could make
by Art. Wel said the Duke then shalt thou see my cunning: for I will
boile thee, straine thee, and then drie thee, so that of a lubber, that
weighed three hundred weight, I will at last make a dram of knaues
powder. The Duke did it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Martin and his mainteiner are both sawers of timber, but
Martin stands in the pit, all the dust must fall in his eies, but he
shal neuer walke on the boards.</i></div>

<p>Martin, if thou to cousen haue crept into the bosome of some great
m&#275;, saying thou hast the churches discipline, and that thou canst
by thy faction and pollicie pull down Bishops and set vp Elders,
bring the lands of the Clergy into the cofers of the Temporaltie,
and repaire Religion, by impairing their liuings, it may bee, thou
shalt bee hearkened too, stroakt on the head, greasd in the hand, fed
daintelie, kept secretlie, and countenaunst mightelie. But when they
perceiue that all thy deuices bee but Chymeraes, monsters of thine owne
imaginations, so farre from pulling downe a Cathedrall Church, that
they cannot remooue a corner of a square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> cap, th&#275; will they deale
with thee as the Duke did with the Alcumist, giue thee as many bobs on
the eare as thou hast eaten morsels of their meate, and make thee an
example of sedition to be pointed at, that art now so mewde vp that
none can point where thou art. All this tale, with the application, was
not of my penning, but found among loose papers; marie he that did it,
dares stand to it. Now, because I haue nothing to doo betweene this and
supper, Ile tell you another tale, and so begin Winter by time.</p>

<p>There was a libeller, who was also a coniurer, so that whatsoeuer
casting of figures there was, he deceiued them; at the last, one as
cunning as himself, shewed, wher he sate writing in a fooles coate, and
so he was caught and whipt. Martin, there are figures a flinging, and
ten to one thou wilt be found sitting in a Knaues skinne, and so be
hangd.</p>

<p>Hollow there, giue me the beard I wore yesterday. O beware of a gray
beard, and a balde head: for if such a one doo but nod, it is right
dudgin and deepe discretion. But soft, I must now make a graue speach.</p>

<p>There is small difference between Swallowes and Martins, either in
shape or nature, saue onely, that the Martins haue a more beetle head,
they both breed in Churches, and hauing fledgde their young ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
leaue nothing behind them but durt. Vnworthie to come into the Church
porch, or to be nourished vnder anie good mans eues, that gnawe the
bowels, in which they were bred, and defile the place, in which they
were ingendred.</p>

<p>They studie to pull downe Bishopps, and set vp Superintendents, which
is nothing else but to raze out good Greeke, and enterline bad Latin.
A fine period; but I cannot continue this stile, let me fal into my
olde vaine. O doost remember, howe that Bastard Iunior complaines of
brothells, and talkes of long Megg of Westminster. A craftie iacke, you
thoght because you twitted Mar-martin, that none would suspect you; yes
faith Martin, you shall bee thresht with your owne flaile.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hee thought Lais had still lien at Corinth as wel as Paul.</i></div>

<p>It was one of your neast, that writt this for a loue letter, to as
honest a wom&#257; as euer burnt malt. 'Grace, mercie, and peace to thee
(O widow) with feruent motions of the spirit, that it may worke in thee
both to will and to doo. Thou knowest my loue to thee is, as Paules was
to the Corinthians; that is, the loue of copulation.'</p>

<p>How now holie Martin, is this good wooing? If you prophane the
Scriptures, it is a pretie wit; if we but alledge Doctors to expound
them, wee are wicked. If Martin oppresse his neighbor, why, hee saith,
it is his conscience; if anie else doo right, it is extremitie. Martin
may better goe into a brothell house, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> anie other go by it; he
slides into a bad place like the Sunne, all others stick in it like
pitch. If Martin speake broad bawdrie, why all the crue saies, your
worship is passing merrie. Martin will not sweare, but with indeede, in
sooth, and in truth, hee'le cogge the die of deceipt, and cutte at the
bumme carde of his conscience. O sweetelie brought in, at least three
figures in that line, besides the wit ant.</p>

<p>One there was, and such a one as Martin would make the eldest of his
Elders, that hauing fortie angels sent him for a beneuolence, refusde
to giue the poore fellowe a quittance for the receipt, saying, Christ
had giuen his master a quittance, the same howre he told it out: and
this was at his table, where he sate with no less than fortie good
dishes of the greatest dainties, in more pompe than a Pope, right like
a superintendent.</p>

<p>Now to the two bastards, what, were you twins? It shuld seeme so, for
ther w&#275;t but a paire of sheeres betweene your knaueries. When the
old henne hatcht such eggs, the diuell was in the cocks comb. Your
father thrusts you forward, remember pettie Martins Aesops crab, the
mother going backward, exhorted her sonnes to goe forward; doo you so
first mother, quoth they, and we will follow. Now the old cuckold hath
puld in his hornes, he would make you creepe cleane out of the shell,
and so both loose your houses and shewe your nakednesse. You go about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
impossibilities, wele no such ch&#257;ge, and if ye had it, ye would be
wearie of it.</p>

<p>There was a man like Martin that had a goose, which euerie daie laid
him a golden egge, he, not content with the blessing, kild his goose,
thinking to haue a myne of golde in her bellie, and finding nothing
but dung, the g&#257;der wisht his goose aliue. Martinists that liue
well by the Church, and receiue great benefites of it, thinke if all
Churches were downe they should be much better, but when they shall see
c&#333;fusion instead of discipline, and atheisme to be found in place
of doctrine, will they not with sighs wish the Churches and Bishops in
their wonted gouernm&#275;t? Thou art well seen in tales, and preachest
Aesops fables. Tush, Ile bring in <i>Pueriles</i>, and <i>Stans puer ad
mensam</i>, for such vnmannerlie knaues as Martin must bee set againe to
their A.B.C. and learn to spell Our Father in a Horne books. Martin
Iunior giues warning that none write against reuerent Martin: yes,
there are <i>a tribus ad centum</i>, from three to an h&#363;dred, that haue
vowed to write him out of his right wittes, and we are all <i>Aptots</i>, in
all cases alike, till we haue brought Martin to the ablatiue case, that
is, to bee taken away with Bulls voyder.</p>

<p>O here were a notable full point, to leaue Martin in the hangmans
apron. Nay, he would be glad to scape with hanging, weele first haue
him lashte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> through the Realme with cordes, that when hee comes to the
gallowes he may be bleeding new.</p>

<p>The babie comes in with <i>Nunka</i>, <i>Næme</i>, and <i>Dad</i> (Pappe with an
hatchet for such a puppie), giue the infant a bibbe, he all to
beslauers his mother tongue, if he driuell so at the mouth and nose,
weele haue him wipte with a hempen wispe. <i>Hui?</i> How often hast thou
talkt of haltring? Whie it runnes still in my minde that they must be
hangd. Hangde is the Que, and it comes iust to my purpose.</p>

<p>There was one endited at a Iaile deliuerie of felonie, for taking vp
an halter by the high way. The Iurie gaue verdit and said guiltie. The
Iudge an honest man, said it was hard to find one guiltie for taking vp
a penie halter, and bad them consider, what it was to cast awaie a man.
Quoth the foreman, we haue enquired throughly, and found there was a
horse tied to the halter. I, marie (quoth the Iudge), then let him be
tied to the halter, and let the horse goe home. Martin, a Monarch in
his owne moyst conceit, and drie counsell, saies he is enuied onelie
because he leuelleth at Bishops; and we say as the Iudge saith, that
if there were nothing else it were hard to persecute them to death;
but when we finde that to the rule of the Church, the whole state of
the Realme is linckt, and that they filching away Bishop by Bishop,
seeke to fish for the Crown, and glew to their newe Church their owne
conclusions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> we must then say, let Bishops stand, and they hang; that
is, goe home. Looke howe manie tales are in this booke, so manie must
you abate of an hundred in the next booke, reckon this for one.</p>

<p>There came by of late a good honest Minister, with a cloake hauing
sleeues: ah (quoth a Martinist, sitting on a bulke in Cheapside) he is
a knaue I warrant you, a claspe would become one of his coate to claspe
his cloak vnder his chinne. Where tis to be noted, that they come in
with a sleeueless conscience, and thinke it no good doctrine which is
not preached with the cloak cast ouer each shoulder like a rippier.</p>

<p>Twas a mad knaue and a Martinist that diuided his sermon into 34 parts
for memorie sake, and would handle but foure for memorie sake, and they
were, why Christ came, wherefore Christ came, for what cause Christ
came, and to what end Christ came; this was all for memorie sake. If
that Martin could thatch vp his Church, this mans scabship should bee
an Elder, and Elders they may bee, which being fullest of spungie pith,
proue euer the driest kixes. For in time you shall see that it is but
a bladder of worldlie winde which swells in their hearts, being once
prickt, the humour will quicklie be remoued, O what a braue state of
the Church it would be for all Ecclesiasticall causes to come before
Weauers and Wierdawers, to see one in a motlie Ierkin and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> apron to
reade the first lesson. The poore Church should play at vnequal game,
for it should loose al by the <i>Elder</i> hand. Nay Mas Martin, weele make
you deale, shuffle as well as you can, we meane to cut it.</p>

<p>If you had the foddring of the sheep you would make the Church like
Primero, foure religions in it, and nere one like another. I cannot out
of his gaming humour. Why? Is it not as good as Martins dogged humour,
who without reuerence, regard, or exception, vseth such vnfitting
tearmes, as were hee the greatest subiect in England hee could not
iustifie them.</p>

<p>Shut the doores (sirs) or giue me my skimmer, Martins mouth had sod
vnskimde these twelue months, and now it runnes ouer; yet let him
alone, he makes but porredge for the diuell.</p>

<p>His Elderberines though it be naught worth, yet is it like an
elderberrie, which being at the ripenes of a perfect black, yet
brused staines ones hands like bloud. They pretending grauitie in the
rottennes of their zeale, bee they once wrung, you shall finde them
lighter than feathers. Thats a simile for the slaues. Nay, Ile touch
them deeper, and make them crie, O my heart, there is a false knaue
among vs.</p>

<p>Take away this beard, and giue me a pickede vaunt, Martin sweares by
his ten bones: nay, I will make him mumpe, mow, and chatter, like old
Iohn of Paris garden before I leaue him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>If Martin will fight Citie fight, wee challenge him at all weapons,
from the taylors bodkin to the watchmans browne bil. If a field may
be pitcht we are readie: if they scratch, wee will bring cattes: if
scolde, we will bring women: if multiplie words, we will bring fooles:
if they floute, we will bring quippes: if dispute the matter, we will
bring schollers: if they buffet, we will bring fists. <i>Deus bone</i>,
what a number of we will brings be here? Nay, we will bring Bull to
hang them. A good note and signe of good lucke, three times motion
of Bull. Motion of Bull? Why, next olde Rosses motion of Bridewell,
Buls motion fits them best. <i>Tria sequuntur tria</i>, in reckoning Bull
thrise, methinkes it should presage hanging. O bad application; Bad?
I doo not thinke there can be a better, than to applie a knaues necke
to an halter. Martin cannot start, I am his shadowe, one parte of the
day before him, another behinde him; I can chalke a knaue on his backe
thrice a weeke, Ile let him bloud in the combe.</p>

<p>Take heed, he will pistle thee. Pistle me? Then haue I a pestle so to
stampe his pistles, that Ile beate all his wit to powder. What will the
powder of Martins wit be good for? Marie, blowe vp a dram of it into
the nostrels of a good Protestant, it will make him giddie; but if you
minister it like Tobacco to a Puritane, it will make him as mad as a
Martin.</p>

<p>Goe to, a hatch before the doore, Martin smels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> thee, and wil not feare
thee; thou knowest how he deales with the Archbishop and a Counseller,
hee will name thee and that broadlie. Name me? Mary he and his shall
bee namefied, that's it I thirst after, that name to name, and knowing
one another, wee may in the streetes grapple; wee except none: wee come
with a verse in our mouthes, courage in our hearts, and weapons in our
hands, and crie</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Discite iustitiam moniti, et non temnere diuos.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Martins conscience hath a periwig; therefore to good men he is more
sower than wig: a Lemman will make his conscience curd like a Posset.
Now comes a biting speach, let mee stroake my beard thrice like a
Germain, before I speak a wise word.</p>

<p>Martin, wee are now following after thee with hue and crie, and are
hard at thy heeles; if thou turne backe to blade it, wee doubt not but
three honest men shall bee able to beate six theeues. Weele teach thee
to commit sacriledge, and to robbe the Church of xxiiij. Bishops at a
blowe. Doost thinke that wee are not men Martin, and haue great men to
defend vs which write? Yes, although with thy seditious cloase, thou
would'st perswade her Maiestie that most of the Gentlemen of account
and men of honour, were by vs thought Puritanes. No, it is your poore
Iohns, that with your painted consciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> haue coloured the religion
of diuers, spreading through the veynes of the Commonwealth like
poyson, the doggednes of your deuotions; which entring in like the
smoothnes of oyle into the flesh, fretteth in time like quicksiluer
into the bones.</p>

<p>When children play with their meate, tis a signe their bellies are
full, and it must be taken from them; but if they tread it vnder their
feete, they ought to be ierkt. The Gospell hath made vs wantons, wee
dallie with Ceremonies, dispute of circumstances, not remembring that
the Papists haue been making roddes for vs this thirtie yeares; wee
shall bee swing'd by them, or worse by Martin, if Martins be worse.
Neuer if it, for they bee worse with a witnesse, and let the dieull
be witnesse. Wee are so nice, that the Cap is a beame in our Church,
the booke of Common Praier a milstone, the <i>Pater noster</i> is not well
pend by Christ. Well, either religion is but policie, or policie scarce
religious.</p>

<p>If a Gentleman riding by the way with twentie men, a number of theeues
should by deuise or force binde all his seruants; the good Iustice of
Peace would thinke he should be robd. When Martinists, rancke robbers
of the Church, shall binde the legges and armes of the Church, me
thinkes the supreme head of the Church should looke pale.</p>

<p>They that pull downe the bells of a steeple, and say it is conscience,
will blow vp the chauncell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> make it the quintessence of conscience.
Bir Ladie, this is a good settled speech, a Diuine might haue seemed to
haue said so much. O sir, I am nor al tales, and riddles, and rimes,
and iestes, thats but my Liripoope, if Martin knock the bone he shall
find marrow, and if he looke for none, we'le knock the bone on his
pate, and bring him on his marie bones.</p>

<p>I haue yet but giuen them a fillip on the conceipt, Ile fell it to the
ground hereafter. Nay, if they make their consciences stretch like
chiuerell in the raine, Ile make them crumple like parchment in the
fire.</p>

<p>I haue an excellent balme to cure anie that is bitten with <i>Martin
mad-dog</i>.</p>

<p>I am worth twentie Pistle-penners; let them but chafe my penne, and it
shal sweat out a whole realme of paper, or make th&#275; odious to the
whole Realme.</p>

<p>O but be not partial, giue them their due though they were diuels, so
will I, and excuse them for taking anie money at interest.</p>

<p>There is a good Ladie that lent one of these Martinists fortie pounds,
and when at the daie shee required her money, Martin began to storme,
and said, he thought her not the child of God, for they must lend,
looking for nothing againe, and so to acquite himselfe of the blot of
vsurie he kepte the principall.</p>

<p>These Martins make the Scriptures a Scriueners shop to drawe
conueyances, and the common pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> of Westminster to take forfeitures.
Theyle not sticke to outlaw a mans soule, and serue it presently with
an execution of damnation, if one denie them to lie with his neighbours
wife. If they bee drunke, they say, they haue Timothie his weake
stomacke, which Saint Paule willeth to warme with wine.</p>

<p>They haue sifted the holie Bible, and left vs nothing as they say, but
branne; they haue boulted it ouer againe and againe, and got themselues
the fine meale; tis meale indeede, for with their wresting and
shuffling holie Writ, they find all themselues good meales, and stand
at liuerie, as it were, at other mens tables.</p>

<p><i>Sed heus tu, dic sodes</i>, will they not bee discouraged for the common
players? Would those Comedies might be allowed to be plaid that are
pend, and then I am sure he would be decyphered, and so perhaps
discouraged.</p>

<p>He shall not bee brought in as whilom he was, and yet verie well, with
a cocks combe, an apes face, a wolfs bellie, cats clawes, etc. but in
a cap'de cloake, and all the best apparell he ware the highest day
in the yeare, thats neither on Christmas daie, Good fridaie, Easter
daie, Ascension, nor Trinitie sundaie (for that were popish), but on
some rainie weeke-daie, when the brothers and sisters had appointed a
match for particular praiers, a thing as bad at the least as Auricular
confession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>If it be shewed at Paules, it will cost you foure pence: at
the Theater two pence: at Sainct Thomas a Watrings nothing.</i></div>

<p>A stage plaier, though he bee but a cobler by occupation, yet his
chance may bee to play the Kings part. Martin, of what calling so euer
he be, can play nothing but the knaues part, <i>qui tantum constans in
knauitate sua est</i>. Would it not bee a fine Tragedie, when <i>Mardocheus</i>
shall play a Bishoppe in a Play, and Martin <i>Hamman</i>, and that he that
seekes to pull downe those that are set in authoritie aboue him, should
be hoysted vpon a tree aboue all other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Reade Martin Seniors Libell, and you shall perceiue that he
is able to teach Gracchus to speake seditiouslie</i>.</div>

<p>Though he play least in sight now, yet we hope to see him stride from
Aldgate to Ludgate, and looke ouer all the Citie at London Bridge.
Soft swift, he is no traytor. Yes, if it bee treason to encourage the
Commons against the chiefe of the Clergie, to make a generall reuolt
from the gouernment so wel established, so wisely maintained, and so
long prospering.</p>

<p>Because they say, <i>Aue Cæsar</i>, therefore they meane nothing against
Cæsar. There may bee hidden vnder their long gownes short daggers, and
so in blearing Cæsars eyes, conspire Cæsars death. God saue the Queene;
why it is the Que which they take from the mouthes of all traytors,
who though they bee throughly conuinced, both by proofe and their owne
confessions, yet at the last gaspe they crie, God saue the Queene. GOD<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
saue the Queene (say I) out of their hands, in whose hearts (long may
the Queene thus gouerne) is not engrauen.</p>

<p>Her sacred Maiestie hath this thirtie yeares, with a setled and
princelie temper swayed the Scepter of this Realme, with no lesse
content of her subiects, than wonder of the world. GOD hath blessed her
gouernment, more by miracle th&#257; by counsaile, and yet by counsaile
as much as can come from policie. Of a State taking such deepe roote,
as to be fastened by the prouidence of God, the vertue of the Prince,
the wisedome of Counsellers, the obedience of subiects, and the length
of time; who would goe about to shake the lowest bough, that feeles in
his conscience but the least blessing. Heere is a fit roome to squese
them with an Apothegme.</p>

<p>There was an aged man that liued in a well ordered Common-wealth by
the space of threescore yeares, and finding at the length that by
the heate of some mens braines, and the warmnes of other mens bloud,
that newe alterations were in hammering, and that it grewe to such an
height, that all the desperate and discontented persons were readie
to runne their heads against their head; comming into the midst of
these mutiners, cried as loude as his yeares would allow; Springalls
and vnripened youthes, whose wisedomes are yet in the blade, when this
snowe shall be melted (laying his hand on his siluer haires)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> then shal
you find store of durt, and rather wish for the continuance of a long
frost, than the comming of an vntimely thaw. Ile moralize this.</p>

<p>Ile warrant the good old man meant, that when the ancient gouernment
of the state should be altered by faction, or newe lawes brought in
that were deuised by nice heads, that there should followe a foule and
slipperie managing; where if happelie most did not fall, yet all would
bee tired. A settled raigne is not like glasse mettal, to be blowne in
bignesse, lenght or fashion of euerie mans breath, and breaking to be
melted againe, and so blowne afresh; but it is compared to the fastning
of the Cedar, that knitteth it selfe with such wreaths into the earth
that it cannot be remooued by any violent force of the aire.</p>

<p>Martin, I haue taken an inuentorie of al thy vnciuill and rakehell
tearmes, and could sute them in no place but in Bedlam and Bridewell,
so mad they are, and so bad they are, and yet all proceedes of the
spirit. I thinke thou art possest with the spirites of Iacke Straw and
the Black-smith, who, so they might rent in peeces the gouernment, they
would drawe cuts for religion.</p>

<p>If all be conscience, let conscience bee the foundation of your
building, not the glasse, shew effects of conscience, mildnesse in
spirit, obedience to Magistrates, loue to thy brethren. Stitch charitie
to thy faith, or rip faith from thy works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>If thou wilt deale soberlie without scoffes, thou shalt be answered
grauely without iests, yea and of those, whom thou canst not controll
for learning, nor accuse for ill life, nor shouldst contemne for
authori[ti]e. But if like a restie Iade thou wilt take the bitt in thy
mouth, and then runne ouer hedge and ditch, thou shalt be brok&#275; as
Prosper broke his horses, with a muzroule, portmouth, and a martingall,
and so haue thy head runne against a stone wall.</p>

<p>If thou refuse learning, and sticke to libelling; if nothing come out
of those lauish lips, but taunts not without bitternesse, yet without
wit; rayling not without spite, yet without cause, then giue me thy
hand, thou and I will trie it out at the cuckingstoole. Ile make thee
to forget Bishops English, and weep Irish; next hanging, there is no
better reuenge on Martin than to make him crie for anger; for there
is no more sullen beast than a he drab. Ile make him pull his powting
croscloath ouer his beetle browes for melancholie, and then my next
booke shall be Martin in his mubble fubbles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I was writing <i>Finis</i> and <i>Funis</i>, and determined to lay it by,
till I might see more knauerie filde in: within a while appeared olde
Martin with a wit worn into the socket, twinkling and pinking like the
snuffe of a candle; <i>quantum mutatus ab illo</i>, how vnlike the knaue hee
was before, not for malice but for sharpnesse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The hogshead was euen come to the hauncing, and nothing could be drawne
from him but dregs: yet the emptie caske sounds lowder than when it was
ful; and protests more in his waining, than he could performe in his
waxing. I drew neere the sillie soule, whom I found quiuering in two
sheetes of protestation paper. O how meager and leane hee lookt, so
creast falne, that his combe hung downe to his bill, and had I not been
sure it was the picture of enuie, I shoulde haue sworne it had been
the image of death, so like the verie Anatomie of mischiefe, that one
might see through all the ribbes of his conscience, I began to crosse
my selfe, and was readie to say the <i>Pater noster</i>, but that I knewe
he carde not for it, and so vsed no other wordes, but <i>abi in malam
crucem</i>, because I knewe, that lookt for him. I came so neere, that I
could feele a substantiall knaue from a sprites shadowe.</p>

<p>I sawe through his paper coffen, that it was but a cosening corse, and
one that had learnde of the holie maid of Kent, to lie in a trance,
before he had brought foorth his lie; drawing his mouth awrie, that
could neuer speake right; goggling with his eyes that watred with
strong wine; licking his lips, and gaping, as though he should loose
his childes nose, if he had not his longing to swallowe Churches; and
swelling in the paunch, as though he had been in labour of a little
babie, no bigger than rebellion; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> truth was at the Bishoppes
trauaile: so that Martin was deliuered by sedition, which pulls the
monster with yron from the beastes bowells. When I perceiued that
he masked in his rayling robes, I was so bolde as to pull off his
shrowding sheete, that all the worlde might see the olde foole daunce
naked.</p>

<p>Tis not a peniworth of protestation that can buy thy pardon, nor al
worth a penie that thou proclaimest. Martin comes in with bloud, bloud,
as though hee should bee a martir. Martins are mad martirs, some of
them burnt seauen yeares agoe, and yet aliue. One of them lately at
Yorke, pulling out his napkin to wipe his mouth after a lie, let drop a
surgeans caliuer at his foote where he stood; these fellowes can abide
no pompe, and yet you see they cannot be without a little squirting
plate: rub no more, the curtall wrinches.</p>

<p>They call the Bishops butchers, I like the Metaphore wel, such calues
must be knockt on the head, and who fitter than the Fathers of the
Church to cut the throates of heresies in the Church. Nay, wh&#275; they
haue no propertie of sheepe but bea, their fleece for flockes, not
cloath, their rotten flesh for no dish, but ditches; I thinke them
woorth neither the tarring nor the telling, but for their scabbednes
to bee thrust from the pinfolde to the scaffold, and with an <i>Habeas
corpus</i> to remooue them from the Shepheards tarre-boxe to the hangmans
budget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>I but he hath sillogismes in pike sauce, and arguments that haue been
these twentie yeres in pickle. I, picke hell, you shall not finde such
reasons, they bee all in <i>celarent</i>, and dare not shewe their heads,
for wee will answere them in <i>ferio</i> and cut their combes. So say they,
their bloud is sought. Their bloud? What should wee doo with it, when
it will make a dogge haue the toothach to eat the puddings.</p>

<p>Martin tunes his pipe to the lamentable note of <i>Ora whine meg</i>. O tis
his best daunce next shaking of the sheetes; but hee good man meant no
harme by it. No more did one of his minions, that thinking to rap out
an oath and sweare by his conscience, mistooke the word and swore by
his concupiscence; not vnlike the theefe, that in stead of God speede,
sayd stand, and so tooke a purse for God morowe.</p>

<p>Yet dooth Martin hope that all her Maiesties best subiects will become
Martinists; a blister of that tongue as bigge as a drummes head; for if
the Queenes Maiestie haue such abiects for her best subiects, let all
true subiects be accompted abiects.</p>

<p>They that teare the boughs, will hew at the tree, and hauing once wet
their feete in factions, will not care how deep they wade in treason.</p>

<p>After Martin had racked ouer his protestation with a Iades pace,
hee runnes ouer his fooleries with a knaues gallop, ripping vp the
souterlie seames of his Epistle, botching in such frize iestes vppon
fustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> earnest, that one seeing all sortes of his shreddes, would
thinke he had robd a taylors shop boord; and then hee concludes all
doggedlie, with Doctor <i>Bullens</i> dogge <i>Spring</i>, not remembring that
there is not a better Spanniell in England to spring a couie of queanes
than Martin.</p>

<p>Hee sliues one, has a fling at another, a long tale of his talboothe,
of a vulnerall sermon, and of a fooles head in souce. This is the
Epistle which he woonders at himselfe, and like an olde Ape, hugges the
Vrchin so in his conceipt, as though it should shew vs some new tricks
ouer the chaine, neuer wish it published Martin, we pittie it before
it comes out. Trusse vp thy packet of flim flams and roage to some
countrey Faire, or read it among boyes in the belfrie, neuer trouble
the church with chattering; but if like dawes, you will be cawing about
Churches, build your nests in the steeple, defile not the quier.</p>

<p>Martin writes merely, because (hee saies) people are carried away
sooner with iest than earnest. I, but Martin neuer put Religion into a
fooles coate; there is great oddes betweene a Gospeller and a Libeller.</p>

<p>If thy vaine bee so pleasaunt, and thy witt so nimble, that all
consists in glicks and girds; pen some play for the Theater, write
some ballads for blind <i>Dauid</i> and his boy, deuise some iests, and
become another <i>Scogen</i>, so shalt thou haue v&#275;t inough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> for all thy
vanities, thy Printer shall purchase, and all other iesters beg.</p>

<p>For to giue thee thy due, thou art the best died foole in graine that
euer was, and all other fooles lacke manie graines, to make them so
heauie.</p>

<p>There is not such a mad foole in Bedlam, nor such a baudie foole in
Bridewell, nor such a dronken foole in the stockes, nor such a scolding
foole on the cucking-stoole, nor such a cosening foole on the pillerie,
nor such a roaging foole in the houses of correction, nor such a simple
foole kept of alms, nor such a lame foole lying in the spittle, nor
in all the world, such a foole, all. Nay for fooles set down in the
scriptures, none such as Martin.</p>

<p>What atheist more foole, that saies in his heart, <i>There is no God</i>?
What foole more proud, that stands in his own c&#333;ceit? What foole
more couetous than he that seekes to tedd abroad the Churches goods
with a forke, and scratch it to himselfe with a rake.</p>

<p>Thou seest Martin with a little helpe, to the foure and twentie orders
of knaues, thou maist solder the foure and twentie orders of fooles,
and so because thou saist thou art vnmarried, thou maist commit
matrimonie, from the heires of whose incest, wee will say that which
you cannot abide, <i>Good Lord deliuer vs</i>.</p>

<p>If this veyne bleede but sixe ounces more I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> proue a pretie
railer, and so in time may growe to bee a proper Martinist. Tush, I doo
but licke ouer my pamphlet, like a Beares whelpe, to bring it in some
forme; by that time he replies, it will haue clawes and teeth, and then
let him looke to bee scratcht and bitten too.</p>

<p>Thou seest Martin Moldwarpe, that hetherto I haue named none, but markt
them readie for the next market: if thou proceed in naming, be as sure
as thy shirt to thy knaues skinne, that Ile name such, as though thou
canst not blush, because thou art past shame, yet they shall bee sorie,
because they are not all without grace.</p>

<p>Pasquil is coming out with the liues of the Saints. Beware my Comment,
tis odds the margent shall be as full as the text. I haue manie
sequences of Saints, if naming be the aduantage, and ripping vp of
liues make sport; haue with thee knuckle deepe, it shall neuer bee said
that I dare not venter mine eares where Martin hazards his necke.</p>

<p>Now me thinkes Martin begins to stretch himselfe like an old fencer,
with a great conscience for buckler and a long tongue for a sword. Lie
close, you old cutter at the locke, <i>Nam mihi sunt vires, et mea tela
nocent</i>. Tis ods but that I shal thrust thee through the buckler into
the brain, that is through the conscience into the wit.</p>

<p>If thou sue me for a double maime, I care not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> though the Iurie allow
thee treble damages, it cannot amount to much, because thy c&#333;science
is without wit, and thy wit without conscience, and therefore both not
worth a penie.</p>

<p>Therefore take this for the first venew, of a yonger brother, that
meanes to drie beate those of the <i>Elder</i> house. Martin, this is my
last straine for this fleech of mirth. I began with God morrowe, and
bid you God night. I must tune my fiddle, and fetch some more rozen,
that it maie squeake out Martins Matachine.</p>

vnlearned discourse of my little wit, which as I wil not intreate you
to commend, deseruing the contrarie: so I hope you will not disdain,
though it deserue discommendation, but so by your pardons excuse my
small discretion by great desire, that hereafter, with less hast, I may

<p class="ph4">THE EPISTLE TO THE GENTLE READER</p>

<p>A new booke says one; true, it came forth but tother day; good stuffe,
says another. Read, then iudge. I confesse it may seeme to a number
a bold attempt to set out a forme of wit, considering the witty
discourses of such fine wits as haue deserued such comendation, as
may driue this meane peece of woorke of mine into vtter disgrace,
were it not that perfect courtesie dooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> bear with imperfect
knowledge, regarding more the good minde in the writer then the matter
written: and therefore the best will giue good words whatsoeuer they
thinke, to encourage a forward wil to doo better, when indeed it
were a fantasticall heade that could doo worse. Well when Wit is a
wool-gathering, and Will wandring the world without guide, what a case
that manne is in that is in such a taking; I referre you to mad folks
of whom you may see examples suficient, and so I being in a certain
melancholie moode past all Gods forbod, tooke my pen and Inke and Paper
and somewhat I would go doo whatsoeuer it were to put out one conceit
and bring in another. At last and at first of a suddaine warres and at
adventures, by God's good helpe and good fortune the little wit that I
had meeting with good Will, I knew not how, fell to worke (at first) I
know not what, but hauing written a while, I made somewhat of it which,
though little to any great purpose, yet if it please the Readers, I
am contented, and if any man thinke it well done then Wit shall think
Will a good boy, and Will shall think hee tooke Wit in a good vaine,
and Will and Wit shall haue the more heart hereafter to fall to further
woorke; but if I haue bin more wilful than wise to trouble your wittes
with a witlesse peece of work pardon me for this once, ye shall see
I will please you better hereafter; in the meane time desiring your
courtesies to commend what you think worthie and not to disdain without
desert, I rest wishing your content in what you wish well as I pray you
wish me as I do you,</p>

<p class="ph4">A PRETIE AND WITTIE DISCOURSE BETWIXT WIT AND WILL</p>

<p>Long have I travelled, much ground have I gone, many wayes have I
trode, mickle mony have I spent, more labour have I lost, in seeking
an olde friend of mine: whose companie so courteous, his counsaile
commodious, his presence so pleasant, and his absence so greevous, that
when I thinke of him, and misse him, I find such a misse of him, as all
things are out of frame with me. And out of frame, can come to no good
fashion. Oh, what shall I do? It is long since I lost him: long have
I sought him. And too long (I fear) it wil be ere I find him. But wot
you who it is? Oh, my Wit, I am from my Wit, and have bin long. Alas
the day, I have bin almost mad with marching through the world without
my good guide, my friend, and my companion, my brother, yea, my selfe.
Alas, where is he? When shall I see him? How shall I seeke him, and
whither shall I walke? I was too soone wearie of him, and am now wearie
of my selfe without him. Well, I will go where I may, I may hap to find
him: but hap is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> unhappie. Therefore hap good, or hap ill, I will walke
on still: if I find him, happie man. If I do not, what then? Content my
selfe even as I can, patience where is no remedie.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Wit.</i></p>

<p>Long have I lookt, far have I sought, oft have I wisht, and sore have
I longed for my merrie mate, my quicke sprite, my dearling, and my
dearest byrd: Whose courtesie so contentive, whose helpe so necessary,
whose necessitie so great, whose presence so pleased me, and absence so
angers mee, that when I would have him, and see I am without him, I am
not in order, and being out of order, can take no good course. Alas,
what shall betide me? I have lost my love, or my love hath lost me.
Would God wee might meete againe, and be merry togither: which I cannot
bee without him? Oh, what have I lost? my Will, whither is he gone?
when will he returne? who hath led him away? or will bring him backe
againe? what company is he falne into? or how doth he leade his life?
Well, time yet may turne him. Till when I wish for him, hoping to meete
him, but hope is uncertaine;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Willes Tale.</i></p>

<p>Oh, good Wit (if thou doost remember), I lost thee in travaile to the
Well of Wisedome. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> when, I have wandred through a wildernesse of
woe, which in the Mappe of that Countrey (I find) is called the Desart
of Desire. Wherein I saw so many wayes, as now in this, and then in
that. At last I came to the hill of Hard Happe, which ledde mee downe
into a Vale of Vanitie. There did I live in the Lake of Miseries,
with the lost people, that having followed Fancie, found Penitence,
the reward of running heads. But Lord what a life it is? I lothe to
thinke on it. Beleeve mee, sweete Wit, there is such falling out with
Fancie, who shifts all upon Folly. Such exclamation upon Folly, who
brings them to Fortune: such cursing and banning of Fortune, for her
froward dealing: in gentle helping them uppe uppon her wheele, and
then suddaine dinging them downe (almost to their destruction), that
if their bee a Hell in this world, there is the place. God keepe all
good mindes from such a filthy corner. <i>Wit.</i> Amen. But tell me how
camst thou thence? <i>Will.</i> I will tell you anon: but first I will tell
you more. There is of all States. Princes crie out of cares: Lordes,
of lacke of living: Ladyes, of false love: souldiers, of want of pay:
Lawyers, of quiet: Poore men, of Lawe: Merchants, of shipwracke:
Mariners, of fowle weather: Usurers, of sermons, and Divines, of
usurie: Players, of Preachers, and Preachers, of Players: Dicers, of
loosing, and losers, of dicing: Cryples, of fighting, and fighters,
of hurts: the Rich, of sicknesse: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Poore, of want: the Sicke, of
paine: the healthfull, of ill happe: the unhappie, of the time that
ever they were borne. Oh, it is a pittious crie: I would not be there
againe, to heare it as I have done, for the gaine of Europe.</p>

<p><i>Wit.</i> Beleeve me, I cannot blame thee: but tell me, how camst thou
thence? <i>Will.</i> Oh, brother, I will tell you how: you know, sometime
travellers must needes have rest, which they must come by as they may:
Now, I having walked (as I told you) through this unpleasant place,
weary at last, I laide mee downe in the ditch of Distresse: where,
finding many dead sculles, and other boanes, I there thought to begin
a sleepe, or sleepe my last: now lying there in such sort as I tell
you, mee thought in my sleepe I sighed, in which sorrow a good motion
of minde set my heart to prayer; which tended to this effect, that it
would please the mightie and mercifull Majestie of the Most Highest, to
send me some meane, to lead me out of this miserie; beeing as it were
from my Wit, and altogither comfortlesse. Now, suddenly there appeared
unto me an olde aged man, who tooke me by the hand, with these words:
Arise, thou sluggish wanton, walke no longer out of thy way, turne thee
backe from this straie pathe, experience doth teach thee: What is Will
without Wit? Prayer hath procured thee pardon, the high and onely God
hath given thee Grace; by Grace goe seeke that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> worth the finding;
look where Wit is; too him, and make much of him. With joy of that
word, I awaked, and with shame of my folly in leaving thee, I hung the
head; with sorrow whereof I was almost of life deprived; but now by thy
sweete welcome wholy revived; now awake (I should say), I saw none but
thee; and now, while I live, I will follow thee.</p>

<p><i>Wit.</i> Why, was it heere you slept, or have you come farre since you
waked? <i>Will.</i> No, no, heere did I sleepe, heere is the place of paine
so unpleasant: but now I see thee, I have received comfort, for that I
know thou canst leade me to Wisdome, who will soone shew me the way to
paradise. <i>Wit.</i> Why then, Will, well hast thou slept, better hast thou
dreamed, but best hast thou waked, to hit on mee so happily, who intend
to bring thee to that good beginning, that shall leade thee to endlesse
blisse. But to quit thy tale, I will tell thee a little of my travaile,
and so we will away togither.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Wits Tale.</i></p>

<p>Will, thou knowest when I left thee, in the lane of Learning, I went on
straight to the schoole of Vertue, and with her Testimoniall, to the
Well of Wisdome, which stands within the pallace of Patience; where I
found the fountaine kept with foure ladies, whose names were Wisdome,
Temperance, Fortitude, and Justice. Now, when I came thither, with
sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> warning from Vertue, yet (for order sake) they thus used
me; Wisedome, which stood with a snake in her hand (over whose head
was written), <i>I see the holes that subtill serpents make</i>, thus used
her warie speech unto me. Sirra (quoth she), how presume you into this
place? from whence came you, and how and whither will you? Lady (quoth
I), from Fancies forte I came, and am now travailing to the forte of
Fame. I came now directly from the schoole of Vertue; brought thither
by Learning had by Reason, servant to Instruction; and heere behold
Patience, who hath lead me, who is further to plead for me. Welcome
(quoth shee), but art thou not wearie? No (quoth I), nor would be, if
the walke had beene longer, to have my will. <i>Will.</i> Why didst thou
thinke me there abouts? Oh, lord, I was far wide. <i>Wit.</i> Peace, Will,
a while: when I denide wearinesse; Yea (quoth Fortitude), an other of
the Dames (over whose head was written, <i>I yield to good, but overthrow
the ill</i>), I will see if you be wearie or not, I must trie a fall with
you. At first I made no account of her, but when I begun, I found her
of great force. Yet in the ende, shee was content to give me over, and
let me come neare the Well. Now, upon the well brinkes stoode Justice,
over whose head was written, <i>my hand hits right, death is my stroke,
my ballance will not lye</i>. Then was my words written down by Memorie,
and weyed with Truth; which being even in judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> shee bad me
welcome, and so was content to let me lay my lips to the sweet lycquor
of Sapience. Oh it is a delicate water!</p>

<p>Now, as I stoode, I heard a trumpet sound; which done, I heard a
voyce which said: What trumpe can sound the true report of Fame? Now
desirous to see the place, whence I heard this sound, I craved the
ladies pasport to the said place, who gave me no other pasport than
the commandement of Patience, warning me in any wise to take hold of
Time, when I met him, and turne him to my use: with these two, I should
come to the forte afore me. I, right glad of my good hap, tooke leave,
and forth I went; anon I met Master Time, with his sithe in his hand,
singing, <i>Save vertue, al things I cut downe, that stand within my
way</i>. But as he came working, I watcht him neare, and as he strooke
aside, I suddenly stept to him, tooke him by the noddle, and turned him
to my work. What wouldest thou (quoth he)? I must not stand idle. No
(quoth I), thou shalt walke, and leade me to the fort of Fame. Come,
then (quoth he). Goe away softly (quoth Patience). Content (quoth
I). And so togither we go to this stately Court; where, being first
entertained by Courtly, we were brought to Favour, and so led up to
Fame. Now, being on knee before her highnesse, she first gave me her
hand to kisse, and willed the lords to bid me welcome. See here (quoth
she) the perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> of affection, what a travaile he hath undertaken
onely for our favour, which he shall be sure of. The Nobles used me
honourably, the Gentlemen courteously, the Servants reverently, and
Favour freendly. Now, as I stood, I heard such sweete musick, such
heavenly songs, it made my heart leape to heare them. The prince did
sing in praise of peace, the lords of plentie, the ladies of true
love, the lawiers of quiet, the servaunts of lawe, the merchaunts of
sayling, and saylers of faire weather, the rich of health, the poore
of charitie, the healthfull of good happe, and the happie of Gods
blessing: there was no usurers, dicers, players, nor fighters heard of.
Oh, there was a place of pleasure; if in the world there be a paradice,
that was it. Oh that thou haddest beene with mee!</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> So would I, but tell me, how came you againe? <i>Wit.</i> I will
tell thee. When I had beene within, and without, and heard such sweete
harmony, of such singular musicke; at last, I came downe into the
base court, led by Favour, to a lodging which was called the counting
house; there sate Memorie, to take the names of such as had bin
entertained, and meant to seeke favour, at the hands of happie Fame.
But as I was going through the court, I met one of the maides of honour
attendaunt upon the princesse, whose name (Favour told me) was Belezza,
accompanied with Gentilezza, another of the maides. Now, as I was
walking, I stared so earnestly on them, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> (not looking to my feete)
I stumbled against a stone, and with the fall I awaked: now awake, I
thought of my good Will; and see how soone it was my happe to meete
with thee; but no sooner then I wished for thee, nor then I am heartily
glad of thee. <i>Will.</i> Gramercy, Wit. But yet I beshrow thee. <i>Wit.</i>
Why so? <i>Will.</i> For loosing mee. <i>Wit.</i> Thou mightest have followed.
<i>Will.</i> You might have held me. <i>Wit.</i> When? <i>Will.</i> When I was neere
you. <i>Wit.</i> Where was that?</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Where you lost me. But tell me one thing, where was it you
slept, and awaked so sodainely? What? was it heere abouts? <i>Wit.</i> Yea,
heere Will, heere, heere is the Forte of Fame, as thou shalt finde,
when thou hast beene with me a while; there is no house, but hath a
sinke; no field so fayre, but hath foule ditch; no place so pleasant,
but hath a corner of anoyance; he that runnes retchlesly, falles
headlong; and hee that is in a hole, he knowes not how, must come out
he knowes not when. Care is to be had in all things, at all times, and
in all places; well, thou hast knowne some sorrowe; learne to leave
selfe judgement; follow friend, go with me. <i>Will.</i> Why? I would never
have lost thee, but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> But that thou wert wearie of me. <i>Will.</i>
Why? I was not wearie, but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> No, but that you were a wanton.
<i>Will.</i> Why? I was not a wanton, but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> No, but that you were
wilfull. <i>Will.</i> Why? I was not wilfull,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> No, but that you
thought better of your selfe than any else. <i>Will.</i> Why? but I did not
thinke so, but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> Nay, you may say you would not have thought so,
but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> But what? or why? <i>Wit.</i> But because you did not see your
selfe. <i>Will.</i> Yes, indeede, but I did; I did see my selfe and you
too. <i>Wit.</i> Indeede, but you did not; for if you had seene me, you
would not so have lost mee. <i>Will.</i> Yes, but I did see you, but when
I had looked on you a while, I looked on my selfe so long, till you
were out of sight, and then I looked after you and could not see you.
<i>Wit.</i> Well, but then you sawe mee not, and so you lost mee; but since
you now have found me, follow me neere, stay but a buts length behinde
mee, least I suddainly steppe a flights shotte before you, and then a
furlong further, you never overtake me. <i>Will.</i> But soft, runnes Wit so
fast, Will is weerie. <i>Wit.</i> Goe too, throw off your clogge of care,
trust to me, so you do as I bid you, all shall be well. <i>Will.</i> Yes,
but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> But what? <i>Will.</i> But a little of your helpe. <i>Wit.</i> Yes,
but&mdash; <i>Will.</i> But? What? <i>Wit.</i> But that you must of your selfe labour.
<i>Will.</i> So I will, but&mdash; <i>Wit.</i> But not too much: well, contented,
I will worke. Wilt thou help? <i>Will.</i> Yea, willingly. <i>Wit.</i> How
long? <i>Will.</i> Till death. <i>Wit.</i> Why, wilt thou dye? <i>Will.</i> Not with
working: yet will I worke sore. <i>Wit.</i> Whereto? <i>Will.</i> To winne my
wish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wit.</i> What is that? <i>Will.</i> You can tell. <i>Wit.</i> But tell me. <i>Will.</i>
What? <i>Wit.</i> Is it favour? <i>Will.</i> That is one parte of it. <i>Wit.</i>
Wealth? <i>Will.</i> An other parte. <i>Wit.</i> Honour? <i>Will.</i> The greatest
next. <i>Wit.</i> Content. <i>Will.</i> All in all. <i>Wit.</i> Where? <i>Will.</i> In
heart. <i>Wit.</i> How? <i>Will.</i> By happe. <i>Wit.</i> How is that? <i>Will.</i> By
hope. <i>Wit.</i> Oh, hope is vaine. <i>Will.</i> Oh, do not discomfort mee.
<i>Wit.</i> Doubt the worst. <i>Will.</i> Wherefore? <i>Wit.</i> Because I bid thee.
<i>Will.</i> Why doo you bid mee? <i>Wit.</i> For this reason: the best will
helpe it selfe. <i>Will.</i> What is the worst? <i>Wit.</i> Envie. <i>Will.</i> What
will hee doo? <i>Wit.</i> Mischiefe. <i>Will.</i> To whome? <i>Wit.</i> To good
mindes. <i>Will.</i> How shall I doo, then? <i>Wit.</i> Let patience use prayer,
God will preserve His servants.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> That I shall: then it is not impossible. <i>Wit.</i> What? <i>Will.</i>
To get content? <i>Wit.</i> It is hard.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> What then? <i>Wit.</i> Doo our best. <i>Will.</i> Content. <i>Wit.</i> But
harke, Will: shall I tell thee a little more of the fort of Fame, what
I sawe and heard before I came away? Over the gate at the entrie, I
sawe written pretie posies, some in Latine, some in Italian, some
French, and some English. In Latine I remember these: <i>Quid tam
difficile quod non solertia vincit?</i> By that was written, <i>Labore
vertus</i>: and by that, <i>Vertute fama</i>: and over that, <i>Fama immortalis</i>:
and that was written in many places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> about the house. In Italian was
written, <i>Gioventù vecchezza</i>: by that, <i>Vecchezza Morte, et Morte
Tempo, et Tempo Fama</i>: but over all, <i>Sopra tutti, triumpha Iddio</i>. In
French, <i>Le fol Fortune, il prudent Fame. Fame est divine, diuinitie
est pretieuse, Dieu est nostre guarde.</i> In English was written.
Patience is a vertue. Vertue is famous. Fame is divine. Divinitie is
gratious. Grace is the gift of God: and God is the onely giver of
grace. Which by patience seekes the vertue that is famous, to the
divine pleasure of the Giver of all good gifts: blessed be His name,
this shall he find, that enters the fort of Fame.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Oh, sweete speeches. <i>Wit.</i> Then wil I tell thee further: as I
walked up and down with Favour, I heard Courtesie and Content (a couple
of courtiers) discoursing of thee and mee. Of the vertues of Wit, and
the vanities of Will.</p>

<p>Wit, they sayde, was desirous of knowledge, but Will could take no
paine: Wit would have patience, but Will would be wood with anger:
Wit would worke, when Will would stand ydle: Wit would be walking,
when Will would bee slouthfull: Wit woulde call for Willes helpe,
when Will cared not for Wits counsaile: Wit woulde bee wise, and Will
would be wanton: Wit would be vertuous, and Will vaine: Wit would be
famous, and Will foolish: Wit would be sober, and Will frantick: Wit
would be carefull, and Will carelesse: Wit studying, and Will playing:
Wit at good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> exercise, and Will idle, and worse occupied: Wit mourning
for Will, Will making no mone for Wit: Wit in his dumps, and Will in
delights: Wit would doo well, and have Will doo no worse, if he would
follow him. But Will would loose Wit, and Wit must worke without Will
and against Wit: and yet this is straunge, they were sworne brethren,
one could not be without the other. Yet Wit could make better shift
alone: Wit could finde Will, when he had lost himselfe, and Will (yet)
would please Wit well, when he would be a good boy: which he would
never be till he were beaten, and that with the smart of his owne rod:
then he would come home to Wit, follow Wit as his best freend, and
never leave him to the last houre.</p>

<p>Now when I heard this discourse I remembred thee, and beeing able to
tarie no longer the hearing of such matter against him whom I love,
I entreated Favour to bring me forth into the court, towardes the
counting house: whither walking, I stumbled by the way, and fell as I
told you: wherewith I awoke. Now, good Will, since I have found thee,
and now thou seest the miseries of the world, come, followe me, let me
bring thee to a better course: let not mee mourne for thee, nor other
thus talke of thee: I will make much of thee, if thou wilt love mee:
I will make thee give them cause to say: See what a chaunge! Will is
come home, Will is content to be ruled by Wit: hee workes with Wit, he
walkes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> Wit: he mournes and is merie with Wit: he is travailing
to Vertue with Wit, he will finde Fame by Wit: why he, Will? He is as
welcome as Wit, as worthie as Wit, now he hath learned of Wit how to
direct his course: beleeve me, Will, I love thee.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Gramercie, good Wit, and I thee. But tell me one thing, mee
thinks all this was but a dreame, for in the ende you did awake with
the fall. <i>Wit.</i> True, Will, I was in a dreame, and so wert thou.
<i>Will.</i> Oh, then, you did heare men talke so much of me in your sleepe:
awake, I warrant you, you shall never heare so much amisse of me.
<i>Wit.</i> I hope so too: now I have met with thee, I will shewe thee a
way, whereby thou shalt deserve no such discredit. <i>Will.</i> Gramercie.
But shall I now tell thee a little that I had forgotten, that I sawe
and hearde in the Lake of Miserie? <i>Wit.</i> Contented, good Will, and
gramercie too.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Then, Wit, thou shalt understand, I heard these speeches past
among penitent people: when Wit is wayward, Will is nobody: wofull Wit,
blames wanton Will: wanton Wit, chides worthy Will: unhappie Wit, hasty
Will: fantastical Wit, forward Will. Over that, Wit thinks scorne of
Will, but yet he cannot bee without him: Wit hath lost Will, but yet
he is glad to seeke him: Wit mournes for Will, but Wit sees it not:
Will travailes for the stone, that Wit must whet himselfe uppon: Will
is painefull, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> Wit unthankful: Will is courteous, but Wit curst:
Will soone content, Wit too curious: Will would be ruled, but Wit had
no reason: Will would have beene famous, had Wit beene vertuous: Will
had beene good, had not Wit beene bad: Will had not lost Wit, had Wit
lookt unto him: Will would doo well, if Wit would doo better: Will
would learne, if Wit would teach him: but Will must worke without Wit,
and against Wit: and yet it was woonderful that sworne brethren should
so disagree, yet one so necessarie for the other in all actions, as
nothing could hit well, when they were asunder. Will could meete Wit in
a maze, and comfort him with his company: Will could bring Wit into a
good order, when he was quite out of course. Wit would be glad of Will:
but when? When he found the want of his freend, which he would never
doo, till he were wearie of working alone: and then he would embrace
Will, make much of Will, and never leave Will for any worlds good. Now
when I heard so much of my good Wit, I could not tarie any longer in
the company, but from them I go, and by my selfe sate downe, where I
slept, and awakt, as I told you.</p>

<p><i>Wit.</i> Gramarcie, good Will; why then I perceive we were both asleepe,
we lost one another in travaile, and travailed in sleepe, to seeke one
another; which walking we have found: happy be this day of our meeting,
and twise happy houre of this our freendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> greeting. Hee runs farre,
that never turnes; hee turnes well, that stayes in time; and hee stayes
well, that stands fast; he stands fast, that never falles; hee falles
lowe, that never riseth; he riseth well, that stands alone when he is
up. Good Will, well met, let us now bee merrie, shake hands, sweare
company, and never part. <i>Will.</i> Content, heere is my hand, my heart
is thine. But ere we goe any further, let us be a little merry. <i>Wit.</i>
What shall we doo? <i>Will.</i> Let us sing. <i>Wit.</i> Content. But what?
<i>Will.</i> What you will; begin, and I will answere you.</p>

as well to my commoditie, comfort, as content. <i>Wit.</i> Well said, Will,
now I like thee well; and, therefore, now I will do my best to worke

none must be privie too, till it be finished; we will heere leave off

better dispatch it.</p>

<p><i>Will.</i> Content, You shall have my helpe in it, or any other thing,
wherein I may stand you in steed. And since you are so glad of my
company, we will live and die togither. <i>Wit.</i> Gramercie, good Will;
and meane time let us pray God to prosper our worke; let us have
care how we worke; what, when, and where we worke, that we may find
it commodious, not contrarie to Gods will, contentive to the best,
offensive to fewe or none; let the matter be vertuous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> so shall he
prove famous. <i>Will.</i> Good Wit, I thanke thee for thy good counsaile;
God give us His grace to doo so. I am glad to see thee so well bent;
now I must needs love thee; thou wert never wont to be so well minded.
<i>Wit.</i> Better late than never; it is good to be honest, though a man
had forsworne it; there is no time too late to thrive. <i>Will.</i> True;
and I promise thee now, I hope I shall doo well by the comfortable
counsaile of so good a friend. God be thanked, the old vaine is gone.

That makes no matter; then sweetes had no sower; but now Wit, oh Will,
dost thou remember all this? I pray thee forget all, and think no more
of such things. I am sorie that ever they were in my heart, but now
thou shall see we will do well inough: we will take another way, to
both our comforts. We will to Care, and intreate him to lend us his

what we begin untowardly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> I promise thee, I heard the pretiest song

<p>(<i>One passage (that of the 'Shake-scene') in Greene's</i> Groat's

discussions of Shakespearian commentators. But the rest has been but
little referred to in comparison; and though it has been reprinted,
it is not, to my knowledge, anywhere accessible as a whole, and is
very generally unknown. It has, however, high interest, both external

earlier euphuist romances and 'conny-catching' pamphlets that it is
much shorter than the best of the former, and that nothing stands
in the same relation to it as Dekker's </i>Hornbook<i> does to the
latter. It wants little more introduction save the reminder that its
autobiographic quality is evidently considerable in fact, if not so
great as in intention, and that it was not printed till after the

censured for some of my former bookes, yet Gentlemen / I protest they
were as I had speciall information. But passing them, I commend this
to your fauorable censures, and like an Embrion without shape, I feare

otherwise: if not, yet will I commend it to your courtesies, that you

<p class="ph4">A GROAT'S WORTH OF WIT</p>

<p>In an Iland bound with the Ocean, there was sometime a Citie situated,
made rich by Marchandize and populous by long space: the name is not
mentioned in the Antiquary, or else worne out by times Antiquitie: what
it was it greatly skilles not: but therein thus it happened. An old new
made Gentleman herein dwelt, of no small credit, exceeding wealth, and
large conscience: he had gathered from many to bestowe vpon one, for
though he had two sonnes, he esteemed but one, that being as himselfe,
brought vp to be goldes bondman, was therefore held heire apparent of
his ill gathered goods.</p>

<p>The other was a Scholler, and maried to a proper Gentlewoman, and
therefore least regarded, for tis an olde said saw: To learning and
law, ther's no greater foe, then they that nothing know: yet was not
the father altogether vnlettered, for he had good experience in a
<i>Nouerint</i>, and by the vniuersall tearmes therein contained, had driuen
many gentlewomen to seeke vnknowen countries: wise he was, for he boare
office in his / parish, and sate as formally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> in his fox-furd gowne, as
if he had beene a very vpright dealing Burges: he was religious too,
neuer without a booke at his belt, and a bolt in his mouth, ready to
shoote through his sinfull neighbor.</p>

<p>And Latin he had some where learned, which though it were but little,
yet was it profitable, for he had this Philosophie written in a ring,
<i>Tu tibi cura</i>, which precept he curiously obserued, being in selfeloue
so religious, as he held it no point of charitie to part with any
thing, of which he liuing might make vse.</p>

<p>But as all mortall things are momentarie, and no certaintie can bee
founde in this vncertaine world, so <i>Gorinius</i> (for that shall be this
Usurers name) after many a goutie pang that had pincht his exterior
parts, many a curse of the people that mounted into heauens presence,
was at last with his last summons, by a deadly disease arrested,
where-against when hee had long contended, and was by Phisitions giuen
ouer, hee cald his two sonnes before him: and willing to performe the
olde prouerbe, <i>Qualis vita finis Ita</i>, hee thus prepared himselfe, and
admonished them. My sonnes (for so your mother said ye were) and so I
assure my selfe one of you is, and of the other I wil make no doubt.</p>

<p>You see the time is come, which I thought would neuer haue approached,
and we must now be seperated, I feare neuer to meete againe. This
sixteene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> yeares daily haue I liued vexed with disease: and might I
liue sixteene more, how euer miserably, I should thinke it happie.
But death is relentlesse, and will not be intreated: witlesse, and
knowes not what good my gold might do him: senseless, &amp; hath no
pleasure in the delightfull places / I would offer him. In breefe, I
thinke he hath with this foole my eldest sonne beene brought vp in
the vniuersitie, and therefore accounts that in riches is no vertue.
But you my sonne (laying then his hand on the yongers head) haue thou
another spirit: for without wealth life is a death: what is gentry if
wealth be wanting, but base seruile beggerie? Some comfort yet it is
vnto me, to see how many gallants sprung of noble parents haue croucht
to <i>Gorinius</i> to haue sight of his gold: O gold, desired golde, admired
golde! and haue lost their patrimonies to <i>Gorinius</i>, because they haue
not returned by their day that adored creature! How many schollers
haue written rimes in <i>Gorinius</i> praise, and receiued (after long
capping and reuerence) a sixpeny reward in signe of my superficiall
liberalitie. Breefely my yong <i>Lucanio</i>, how I haue bin reuerenst thou
seest, when honester men I confesse, haue beene set farre off: for to
be rich is to be any thing, wise, honest, worshipfull, or what not? I
tell thee my sonne: when I came first to this Cittie, my whole wardrop
was onely a sute of white sheepe skins, my wealth an olde Groate, my
wooning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> the wide world. At this instant (O griefe to part with it) I
haue in readie coyne threescore thousand pound, in plate and Jewels,
xv. thousand, in bonds and specialties as much, in land nine hundred
pound by the yeere: all which, <i>Lucanio</i> I bequeath to thee, onely I
reserue for <i>Roberto</i> thy well red brother, an olde Groate (being the
stocke I first began with) wherewith I wish him to buy a groatsworth of
wit: for he in my life hath reprooued my maner of life, and therefore
at my death, shall not be contaminated with corrupt gaine. Heere by the
way Gentlemen must I disgresse to shew the reason of <i>Gorinius</i> present
speech: <i>Roberto</i> being / come from the Academie, to visit his father,
there was a great feast prouided: where for table talke, <i>Roberto</i>
knowing his father and most of the companie to be execrable vsurers,
inuayed mightily against that abhorred vice, insomuch that he vrged
teares from diuers of their eyes, and compunction in some of their
hearts. Dinner being past, hee comes to his father, requesting him to
take no offence at his liberall speech, seeing what he had vttered was
truth. Angrie, sonne (saide he) no by my honesty (&amp; that is somwhat I
may say to you), but vse it still, and if thou canst perswade any of my
neighbours from lending vppon vsurie, I should haue the more customers:
to which when <i>Roberto</i> would haue replied, he shut himselfe into his
studie, and fell to telling ouer his money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>This was <i>Robertos</i> offence: nowe returne we to seeke <i>Gorinius</i>, who
after he had thus vnequally distributed his goods and possessions,
began to aske his sons how they liked his bequestes: either seemed
agreed, and <i>Roberto</i> vrged him with nothing more, then repentance of
his sin: Loke to thine owne, said he, fond boy, and come my <i>Lucanio</i>,
let me giue thee good counsel before my death: as for you sir, your
bookes are your counsellors, and therefore to them I bequeath you. Ah
<i>Lucanio</i>, my onely comfort, because I hope thou wilt as thy father
be a gatherer, let me blesse thee before I die. Multiply in wealth my
sonne by anie meanes thou maist, onely flie Alchymie, for therein are
more deceites then her beggerly Artistes haue wordes; and yet are the
wretches more talkatiue then women. But my meaning is, thou shouldest
not stand on conscience in causes of profite, but heape treasure vpon
treasure, for the time of neede: yet seeme / to be deuout, else shalt
thou be held vile: frequent holy exercises, graue companie, and aboue
all, vse the conuersation of yong Gentlemen, who are so wedded to
prodigalitie, that once in a quarter necessity knocks at their chamber
doores: profer them kindnesse to relieue their wants, but be sure of
good assurance: giue faire words till dayes of payment come, and then
vse my course, spare none: what though they tell of conscience (as a
number will talke) looke but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> into the dealings of the world, &amp; thou
shalt see it is but idle words. Seest thou not many perish in the
streetes, and fall to theft for neede: whom small succor would releeue.
Then where is conscience, and why art thou bound to vse it more then
other men? Seest thou not daily forgeries, periuries, oppressions,
rackings of the poore, raysing of rents, inhauncing of duties, euen by
them that shuld be all conscience, if they meant as they speake: but
<i>Lucanio</i> if thou reade well this booke, (and with that hee reacht him
Machiauels works at large) thou shalt see what it is to be foole-holy,
as to make scruple of conscience, where profit presents it selfe.</p>

<p>Besides, thou hast an instance by thy threed-bare brother heere, who
willing to do no wrong, hath lost his childs right: for who would wish
any thing to him, that knowes not how to vse it?</p>

<p>So much <i>Lucanio</i> for conscience: and yet I knowe not whats the reason,
but somewhat stings mee inwardly when I speake of it. I, father,
said <i>Roberto</i>, it is the worme of conscience, that vrges you at the
last houre to remember your life, that eternall life may follow your
repentance. Out foole (said this miserable father) I feele it now, it
was onely a stitch. I will forward with my exhortation to <i>Lucanio</i>.
As I saide my / sonne, make spoyle of yong gallants by insinuating thy
selfe amongst them, and be not mooued to think their Auncestors were
famous, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> consider thine were obscure, and that thy father was the
first Gentleman of the name: <i>Lucanio</i> thou art yet a Bachelor, and
so keepe thee, till thou meete with one that is thy equall, I meane
in wealth: regard not beautie, it is but a baite to entice thine
neighbors eie: and the most faire are commonly most fond: vse not too
many familiars, for few prooue friends, and as easie it is to weigh
the wind, as to diue into the thoughts of worldly glosers. I tell thee
<i>Lucanio</i>, I haue seene foure score winters besides the odde seauen,
yet saw I neuer him that I esteemed as my friend but gold, that desired
creature, whom I haue deerely loued, and found so firme a friend, as
nothing, to me hauing it, hath beene wanting. No man but may thinke
deerely of a true friend, and so doe I of it, laying it vnder sure
locks, and lodging my heart therwith.</p>

<p>But now (Ah my <i>Lucanio</i>) now must I leaue it, and to thee I leaue it
with this lesson, loue none but thy selfe, if thou wilt liue esteemed.
So turning him to his study, where his chiefe treasure lay, he loud
cried out in the wise mans words, <i>O mors quam amara</i>, O death how
bitter is thy memorie to him that hath al pleasures in this life,
and so with two or three lamentable groanes he left his life: and to
make short worke, was by <i>Lucanio</i> his sonne enterd, as the custome
is with some solemnitie: But leauing him that hath left the world to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>him y<sup>t</sup> censureth of euery worldly man, passe we to his sons: and see
how his long laied vp store is by <i>Lucanio</i> looked into. The youth
was of c&#333;dition simple, shamefast, and flexible to any counsaile,
which <i>Roberto</i> perceiuing, and pondering how little was left to him,
grew into an inward contempt of his fathers vnequall legacie, and
determinate resolution to worke <i>Lucanio</i> al possible iniurie: here
vpon thus conuerting the sweetnesse of his studie to the sharpe thirst
of reuenge, he (as Enuie is seldome idle) sought out fit companions
to effect his unbrotherly resolution. Neither in such a case is ill
companie farre to seeke, for the Sea hath scarce so ioperdies, as
populous Citties haue deceiuing Syrens, whose eies are Adamants, whose
wares are witchcrafts, whose doores leade downe to death. With one of
these female Serpents <i>Roberto</i> consorts, and they conclude, what euer
they compassed, equally to share to their contentes. This match made,
<i>Lucanio</i> was by his brother brought to the bush, where he had scarce
pruned his wings but hee was fast limed, and <i>Roberto</i> had what he
expected. But that we may keepe forme, you shall heare how it fortuned.</p>

<p><i>Lucanio</i> being on a time very pensiue, his brother brake with him in
these tearmes. I wonder <i>Lucanio</i> why you are so disconsolate, that
want not any thing in the world that may worke your content. If wealth
may delight a man, you are with that suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>ciently furnisht: if credit
may procure a man any comfort, your word I knowe well, is as well
accepted as any mans obligation: in this Citie are faire buildings and
pleasant gardens, and cause of solace: of them I am assured you haue
your choyse. Consider brother you are yong, then plod not altogether
in meditating on our fathers precepts: which howsoeuer they sauoured
of profit, were most vnsauerly to one of your yeeres applied. You must
not thinke but certaine Marchants of this Citie expect your company,
sundry Gentlemen desire your / familiarity, and by conuersing with
such, you will be accounted a Gentleman: otherwise a pesant, if ye
liue thus obscurely. Besides, which I had almost forgot, and then had
all the rest beene nothing, you are a man by nature furnished with all
exquisite proportion, worthy the loue of any courtly Ladie, be she
neuer so amorous: you haue wealth to maintaine her, of women not little
longed for: wordes to court her you shall not want, for my selfe will
be your secretary. Brieflie, why stande I to distinguish abilitie in
perticularities, when in one word it may be sayde, which no man can
gainsay, <i>Lucanio</i> lacketh nothing to delight a wife, nor any thing but
a wife to delight him? My young maister beeing thus clawde, and puft vp
with his owne prayse, made no longer delay, but hauing on his holyday
hose, he tricked himselfe vp, and like a fellowe that meant good sooth,
hee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> clapped his Brother on the Shoulder, and sayde. Faith Brother
<i>Roberto</i>, and yee say the worde, lets go seeke a wife while it is
hote, both of vs togither. Ile pay well, and I dare turne you loose to
say as well as anye of them all: well Ile doe my best, said <i>Roberto</i>,
and since ye are so forward, lets goe nowe and trie our good fortune.</p>

<p>With this foorth they walke, and <i>Roberto</i> went directlie towarde the
house where <i>Lamilia</i> (for so wee call the Curtezan) kept her Hospital,
which was in the Suburbes of the Cittie, pleasauntly seated, and made
more delectable by a pleasaunt Garden, wherein it was scituate. No
sooner come they within ken, but Mistresse <i>Lamilia</i> like a cunning
angler made readie her chaunge of baytes, that shee might effect
<i>Lucanios</i> bane: and to begin, shee discouered from her window her
beauteous inticing face, and taking a lute in her h&#257;d that / she
might the rather allure, she sung this Sonnet with a delicious voice.</p>

<p>While this painted sepulchre was shadowing her corrupting guilt,
Hiena-like alluring to destruction, <i>Roberto</i> and <i>Lucanio</i> vnder
the windowe, kept euen pace with / euery stop of her instrument, but
especially my yong Ruffler (that before time like a bird in a cage,
had beene prentise for three liues or one and twentie yeeres at least,
to esteame Auarice his deceased father). O twas a world to see how he
sometime simperd it, striuing to set a countenance on his turnd face,
that it might seeme of wainscot proofe, to beholde her face without
blushing: anone he would stroake his bow-bent-leg, as though he went
to shoote loue arrows from his shins: then wipte his chin (for his
beard was not yet grown) with a gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> wrought handkercher, whence of
purpose he let fall a handfull of angels. This golden showre was no
sooner rained, but <i>Lamil[i]a</i>, ceast her song, and <i>Roberto</i> (assuring
himselfe the foole was caught) came to <i>Lucanio</i> (that stoode now as
one that had starde <i>Medusa</i> in the face) and awaked him from his
amazement with these words: What, in a traunce brother? whence springs
these dumps? are yee amazed at this obiect? or long ye to become loues
subiect? Is there not difference betweene this delectable life and the
imprisonment you haue all your life hitherto endured? If the sight and
hearing of this harmonious beautie work in you effects of wonder, what
will the possession of so diuine an essence, wherein beautie and Art
dwell in their perfect excellencie. Brother said <i>Lucanio</i>, lets vse
few words, and she be no more then a woman, I trust youle helpe mee to
her? and if you doe, well, I say no more, but I am yours till death vs
depart, and what is mine shal ye yours, world without end, Amen.</p>

<p><i>Roberto</i> smiling at his simplenesse, helpt him to gather vp his dropt
golde, and without any more circumstance led him to <i>Lamilias</i> house:
for of such places it may be said as of hell. /</p>

<p class="center">
Noctes atque dies patet atri ianua ditis.
</p>

<p>So their doores are euer open to entice youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> to destruction. They
were no sooner entred, but <i>Lamilia</i> her selfe, like a second <i>Helen</i>,
court-like begins to salute <i>Roberto</i>, yet did her wandring eie glance
often at <i>Lucanio</i>: the effect of her entertainment consisted in
these tearmes, that to her simple house Signor <i>Roberto</i> was welcome,
and his brother the better welcome for your sake: albeit his good
report confirmed by his present demeaner, were of it selfe enough
to giue him deserued entertainement, in any place how honourable
soeuer: mutuall thanks returned, they lead this prodigal childe into
a Parlor, garnished with goodly portratures of amiable personages:
neere which, an excellent consert of musicke began at their entrance
to play. <i>Lamilia</i> seeing <i>Lucanio</i> shamefast, tooke him by the hand,
and tenderly wringing him, vsed these words: Beleeue me Gentlemen, I
am verie sorie that our rude enter[tain]ment is such, as no way may
worke your content: for this I haue noted since your first entering,
that your countenance hath beene heauie, and the face being the glasse
of the heart, assures me the same is not quiet: would ye wish any
thing heere that might content you, say but the word, and assure ye of
present deliuerance to effect your full delight. <i>Lucanio</i> being so
farre in loue, as he perswaded himselfe without her grant hee could
not liue, had a good meaning to vtter his minde, but wanting fit
wordes, hee stoode like a trewant that lackt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> prompter, or a plaier
that being out of his part at his first entrance is faine to haue the
booke to speake what he should performe. Which <i>Roberto</i> perceiuing
replied thus in his behalfe: Madame, the Sunnes brightnesse daisleth
the beholders eies, the maiestie of Gods, / amazed humane men. <i>Tullie</i>
Prince of Orators, once fainted though his cause were good, and he
that tamed monsters, stoode amated at beauties ornaments: Then blame
not this yoong man though hee replied not, for he is blinded with the
beautie of your sunne-darkening eies, made mute with the celestiall
organe of your voyce, and feare of that rich ambush of amber colored
darts, whose pointes are leuelde against his heart. Well Signor
<i>Roberto</i> saide shee, how euer you interpret their sharpe leuell, be
sure they are not bent to doe him hurt, and but that modestie blindes
vs poore Maidens from vttering the inwarde sorrowe of our mindes,
perchaunce the cause of greefe is ours, how euer men do colour, for
as I am a virgin I protest (and therewithall shee tainted her cheekes
with a vermilion blush) I neuer sawe Gentleman in my life in my eie
so gratious as is <i>Lucanio</i>, onely that is my greefe, that either
I am despised for that he scornes to speake, or else (which is my
greater sorrow) I feare he cannot speake. Not speake Gentlewoman quoth
<i>Lucanio?</i> that were a ieast indeede: yes, I thanke God I am sounde of
winde and lim, onely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> my heart is not as it was woont: but and you be
as good as your word, that will soone be well, and so crauing ye of
more acquaintance, in token of my plaine meaning receiue this diamond,
which my olde father loued deerely: and with that deliuered her a
Ring, wherein was apointed a Diamond of wonderfull worth. Which shee
accepting with a lowe conge, returned him a silke Riband for a fauour,
tyed with a truelouers knot, which he fastened vnder a faire Jewell on
his Beuer felt.</p>

<p>After this <i>Diomedis &amp; Glauci permutatio</i>, my young master / waxed
cranke, and the musicke continuing, was very forward in dauncing, to
shew his cunning: and so desiring them to play on a hornepipe, laid on
the pauement lustily with his leaden heeles, coruetting like a steede
of <i>Signor Roccoes</i> teaching, and wanted nothing but bels, to bee a
hobbyhorse in a morrice. Yet was he soothed in his folly, and what
euer he did, <i>Lamilia</i> counted excellent: her praise made him proude,
insomuch that if he had not beene intreated, hee would rather haue died
in his daunce, then left off to shew his mistresse delight. At last
reasonably perswaded, seeing the table furnished, he was contented to
cease, and settle himselfe to his victuals, on which (hauing before
labored) he fed lustily, especially of a Woodcocke pie, wherewith
<i>Lamilia</i> his caruer, plentifully plied him. Full dishes hauing
furnisht emptie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> stomaches, and <i>Lucanio</i> thereby got leisure to talke,
falles to discourse of his wealth, his lands, his bonds, his abilitie,
and how himselfe with all he had, was at Madame <i>Lamilias</i> disposing:
desiring her afore his brother, to tell him simply what shee meant.
<i>Lamilia</i> replied: My sweet <i>Lucanio</i>, how I esteeme of thee mine
eies doe witnesse, that like handmaides, haue attended thy beautious
face, euer since I first beheld thee: yet seeing loue that lasteth
gathereth by degrees his liking, let this for that suffice: if I finde
thee firme, <i>Lamilia</i> will be faithful: if fleeting, she must of
necessitie be infortunate that hauing neuer seene any whome before shee
could affect, shee shoulde bee of him iniuriously forsaken. Nay saide
<i>Lucanio</i>, I dare say my brother here will giue his word. For that
I accept your own said <i>Lamilia</i>, for with me your credit is better
then your brothers. <i>Roberto</i> brake off their amorous prattle with
these speeches. Sith / either of you are of other so fond at the first
sight, I doubt not but time will make your loue more firme. Yet madame
<i>Lamilia</i> although my brother and you be thus forward, some crosse
chaunce may come: for <i>Multa cadunt inter calicem supremaq. labra</i>. And
for a warning to teach you both wit, Ile tell you an olde wiues tale.</p>

<p>Before ye go on with your tale (quoth mistresse <i>Lamilia</i>) let me giue
ye a caueat by the way, which shall be figured in a Fable.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lamiliaes Tale.</i></p>

<p>The Foxe on a time came to visite the Gray, partly for kindered,
cheefely for craft: and finding the hole emptie of all other companie,
sauing onely one Badger; enquiring the cause of his solitarinesse,
he described the sodaine death of his dam and sire, with the rest of
his consorts. The Foxe made a Friday face, counterfeiting sorrow: but
concluding that deaths shake was vneuitable, perswaded him to seeke
some fit mate wherwith to match. The Badger soone agreed: so forth
they went, and in their way met with a wanton ewe straggling from the
fold: the Foxe bad the Badger play the tall stripling, and strout on
his tiptoes: for (quoth he) this ewe is lady of al these lands, and her
brother cheefe bel-weather of sundrie flocks. To be short, by the Foxes
permission there would be a perpetuall league betweene her harmelesse
kindred and al other deuouring beasts, for that the Badger was to
them all allied: seduced, shee yeelded: and the Foxe conducted them
to the Badgers / habitation, where drawing her aside vnder color of
exhortation, [he] pulde out her throate to satisfie his greedie thurst.
Here I should note, a yoong whelpe that viewed their walke, infourmed
the shepheard of what hapned. They followed, and trained the Foxe and
Badger to the hole: the Foxe afore had craftily conuaied him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>self
away: the shepheard found the Badger rauing for the ewes murther:
his lamentation being helde for counterfet, was by the shepheards
dog wearied. The Foxe escaped: the ewe was spoiled: and euer since,
betweene the Badgers and the dogges, hath continued a mortall enmitie:
And now be aduised <i>Roberto</i> (quoth she), goe forward with your tale,
seeke not by slie insinuation to turne our mirth to sorrow. Go too
<i>Lamilia</i> (quoth hee), you feare what I meane not, but how euer ye take
it, Ile forward with my tale.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Robertoes Tale.</i></p>

<p>In the North parts there dwelt an old Squier, that had a yong daughter
his heire; who had (as I know Madame <i>Lamilia</i> you haue had) many
youthfull Gentlemen that long time sued to obtaine her loue. But she
knowing her owne perfection (as women are by nature proude) woulde not
to any of them vouchsafe fauour: insomuch that they perceiuing her
relentlesse, shewed themselues not altogether witlesse, but left her
to her fortune, when they founde her frowardnesse. At last it fortuned
among other strangers, a Farmers sonne visited her fathers house: on
whom at the first sight shee was enamored, he likewise on hir. Tokens
of loue past betweene them, either acquainted others parents of their
choise, and they kindly gaue their consent. Short tale to make, married
they were, and great solemnitie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> at the wedding feast. A yong
Gentleman, that had beene long a suter to her, vexing that the sonne
of a farmer should be so preferred, cast in his minde by what meanes
(to marre their merriment) he might steale away the Bride. Hereupon he
confers with an old beldam, called mother <i>Gunby</i>, dwelling thereby,
whose counsell hauing taken, he fell to his practise, and proceeded
thus. In the after noone, when dauncers were very busie, he takes the
Bride by the hand, and after a turne or two, tels her in her eare, he
had a secret to impart vnto her, appointing her in any wise, in the
euening to find a time to confer with him: she promised she would and
so they parted. Then goes he to the bridegroome, and with protestations
of entire affect, protests that the great sorrow hee takes at that
which he must vtter, whereon depended his especial credit, if it were
knowne the matter by him should be discouered. After the bridegroomes
promise of secrecie, the gentleman tels him, that a friend of his
receiued that morning from y<sup>e</sup> bride a letter, wherein she willed him
with some sixteene horse to awaite her comming at a Parke side, for
that she detested him in her heart as a base country hinde, with whom
her father compelled her to marrie. The bridegroome almost out of his
wits, began to bite his lippe. Nay, saith the Gentleman, if you will
by me be aduised, you shall saue her credit, win her by kindnes, and
yet preuent her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> wanton complot. As how, said the Bridegroome? Mary,
thus, said the gentleman: In the euening (for till the guests be gone
she intends not to gad) get you / on horsebacke, and seeme to be of
the companie that attends her comming: I am appointed to bring her
from the house to the Parke, and from thence fetch a winding compasse
of a mile about, but to turne vnto olde mother <i>Gunbyes</i> house, where
her louer my friend abides: when she alights, I wil conduct her to a
chamber far from his lodging, but when the lights are out, and she
expects her adulterous copesmate, your selfe (as reason is) shall proue
her bedfellow, where priuately you may reprooue her, and in the morning
earely returne home without trouble. As for the gentleman my frend,
I will excuse her absence to him, by saying, shee mockt thee with
her maide in stead of her selfe, whom when I knew at her lighting, I
disdained to bring her vnto his presence. The Bridegroome gaue his hand
it should be so.</p>

<p>Now by the way we must vnderstand this mother <i>Gunby</i> had a daughter,
who all that day sate heauily at home with a willow garland, for that
the bridegroome (if he had dealt faithfully) should haue wedded her
before any other. But men (<i>Lamilia</i>) are vnconstant, mony now a daies
makes the match, or else the match is marde.</p>

<p>But to the matter: the bride groome and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> Gentleman thus agreed:
he tooke his time, conferred with the bride, perswaded her that her
husband (notwithstanding his faire shew at the marriage) had sworne to
his old sweete heart, their neighbour <i>Gunbyes</i> daughter, to be that
night her bedfellow: and if she would bring her father, his father, and
other friends to the house at midnight, they should finde it so.</p>

<p>At this the yong gentlewoman inwardly vext to be by a peasant so
abused, promised if she sawe likelyhood of / his slipping away, that
then she would doe according as he directed.</p>

<p>All this thus sorting, the old womans daughter was trickly attired,
ready to furnish this pageant, for her old mother promised all things
necessarie.</p>

<p>Well, Supper past, dauncing ended, all the guests would home, and
the Bridgroome pretending to bring some friend of his home, got his
horse, and to the Parke side he rode, and stayed with the horsemen that
attended the Gentleman.</p>

<p>Anone came <i>Marian</i> like mistris Bride, and mounted behind the
gentleman, away they post, fetch their compasse, &amp; at last alight at
an olde wiues house, where sodenly she is conuaied to her chamber, &amp;
the bridegroome sent to keepe her company: where he had scarce deuised
how to begin his exhortation, but the father of his bride knockt at the
chamber doore. At which being somewhat amazed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> yet thinking to turne
it to a ieast, sith his wife (as he thought) was in bed with him, hee
opened the doore, saying: Father, you are heartily welcome, I wonder
how you found vs out heere; this deuise to remooue our selues, was with
my wiues consent, that we might rest quietly without the Maids and
Batchelers disturbing vs. But where is your wife said y<sup>e</sup> gentleman?
why heere in bed said he. I thought (quoth the other) my daughter had
beene your wife, for sure I am to-day shee was giuen you in marriage.
You are merrily disposed said the Bridegroome, what, thinke you I haue
another wife? I thinke but as you speake, quoth the gentleman, for my
daughter is below, &amp; you say your wife is in the bed. Below (said he)
you are a merie man, and with that casting on a night-gowne, he went
downe, where when he saw his wife, the gentleman his father, and a
number / of his friends assembled, he was so confounded, that how to
behaue himselfe he knew not; onely hee cried out that he was deceiued.
At this the olde woman arises, and making her selfe ignorant of al
the whole matter, enquires the cause of that sodaine tumult. When she
was tolde the new bridegroome was found in bed with her daughter, she
exclaimed against so great an iniurie. <i>Marian</i> was called in quorum:
she iustified it was by his allurement: he being condemned by al their
consents, was iudged vnworthy to haue the gentlewoman vnto his wife,
&amp; compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> (for escaping of punishment) to marrie <i>Marian</i>: and the
yong Gentleman (for his care in discouering the farmers sonnes leudnes)
was recompenst with the Gentlewomans euer during loue.</p>

<p>Quoth <i>Lamilia</i>, and what of this? Nay nothing saide <i>Roberto</i>, but
that I haue told you the effects of sodaine loue: yet the best is, my
brother is a maidenly batcheler, and for your selfe, you haue beene
troubled with many suters. The fewer the better, said <i>Lucanio</i>. But
brother, I con you little thanke for this tale: hereafter I pray you
vse other table talke. Lets then end talk, quoth <i>Lamilia</i>, and you
(signor <i>Lucanio</i>) and I will goe to the Chesse. To Chesse, said he,
what meane you by that? It is a game, said she, that the first danger
is but a checke, the worst, the giuing of a mate. Wel, said <i>Roberto</i>,
that game ye haue beene at alreadie then, for you checkt him first with
your beauty, &amp; gaue your self for mate to him by your bountie. That is
wel taken brother, said <i>Lucanio</i>, so haue we past our game at Chesse.
Wil ye play at tables then, said she? I cannot, quoth he, for I can
goe no furder with my game, if I be once taken. Will ye play then at
cards? I, said he, if it be at one and thirtie. That fooles game, said
she? Weele all to hazard, said <i>Roberto</i>, and / brother you shall make
one for an houre or two: contented quoth he. So to dice they went,
and fortune so fauoured <i>Lucanio</i>, that while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> continued square
play, he was no looser. Anone cosonage came about, and his Angels being
double winged flew cleane from before him. <i>Lamilia</i> being the winner,
prepared a banquet; which finished, <i>Roberto</i> aduised his brother to
depart home, and to furnish himselfe with more crowns, least he were
outcrakt with new commers.</p>

<p><i>Lucanio</i> loath to be outcountenanst, followed his aduise, desiring
to attend his returne, which he before had determined vnrequested:
for as soone as his brothers backe was turned, <i>Roberto</i> begins to
reckon with <i>Lamilia</i>, to bee a sharer as well in the mony deceitfully
woone, as in the Diamond so wilfully giuen. But she, <i>secundum mores
meretricis</i>, iested thus with the scholler. Why <i>Roberto</i>, are you so
well read, and yet shew your selfe so shallow witted, to deeme women
so weake of conceit, that they see not into mens demerites? Suppose
(to make you my stale to catch the woodcocke, your brother) that my
tongue ouerrunning mine intent, I spake of liberal rewarde; but what
I promised, there is the point; at least what I part with, I will be
well aduised. It may be you wil thus reason: Had not <i>Roberto</i> trained
<i>Lucanio</i> with <i>Lamilias</i> lure, <i>Lucanio</i> had not now beene <i>Lamilias</i>
prey: therfore sith by <i>Roberto</i> she possesseth her prize, <i>Roberto</i>
merites an equall part. Monstrous absurd if so you reason; as wel you
may reason thus: <i>Lamilias</i> dog hath kilde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> her a deere, therefore his
mistris must make him a pastie. No poore pennilesse Poet, thou art
beguilde in me, and yet I wonder how thou couldest, thou hast beene so
often beguilde. But it fareth with licentious men, as with the chased
bore in the / streame, who being greatly refreshed with swimming, neuer
feeleth any smart vntill he perish recurelesly wounded with his owne
weapons. Reasonlesse <i>Roberto</i>, that hauing but a brokers place, asked
a lenders rewarde. Faithlesse <i>Roberto</i>, that hast attempted to betray
thy brother, irreligiously forsaken thy wife, deseruedly beene in thy
fathers eie an abiect: thinkest thou <i>Lamilia</i> so loose, to consort
with one so lewd? No hypocrite, the sweete Gentleman thy brother, I
will till death loue, and thee while I liue loath. This share <i>Lamilia</i>
giues thee, other gettest thou none.</p>

<p>As <i>Roberto</i> would haue replied, <i>Lucanio</i> approached: to whom
<i>Lamilia</i> discourst the whole deceit of his brother, &amp; neuer rested
intimating malitious arguments, till <i>Lucanio</i> vtterly refused
<i>Roberto</i> for his brother, and for euer forbad him of his house. And
when he wold haue yeelded reasons, and formed excuse, <i>Lucanios</i>
impatience (vrged by her importunate malice) forbad all reasoning with
them that was reasonlesse, and so giuing him Jacke Drums entertainment,
shut him out of doores: whom we will follow, and leaue <i>Lucanio</i> to the
mercie of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> <i>Lamilia</i>. <i>Roberto</i> in an extreame extasie rent his haire,
curst his destinie, blamed his trecherie, but most of all exclaimed
against <i>Lamilia</i>: and in her against all enticing Curtizans in these
tearmes.</p>

<p>With this he laide his head on his hand, and leant his elbow on the
ground sighing out sadly,</p>

<p class="center">
Heu patior telis vulnera facta meis.
</p>

<p>On the other side of the hedge sate one that heard his sorrow, who
getting ouer, came towardes him, and brake off his passion. When he
approached, he saluted <i>Roberto</i> in this sort.</p>

<p>Gentleman, quoth hee (for so you seeme), I haue by chaunce heard you
discourse some part of your greefe; which appeareth to be more then
you will discouer, or I can conceipt. But if you vouchsafe such simple
comfort as my abilitie will yeeld, assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> your selfe that I will
endeuour to doe the best, that either may procure your profit, or bring
you pleasure: the rather, for that I suppose you are a scholler, and
pittie it is men of learning should liue in lacke.</p>

<p><i>Roberto</i> wondring to heare such good words, for that this iron
age affoordes few that esteeme of vertue, returned him thankfull
gratulations, and (vrged by necessitie) vttered his present griefe,
beseeching his aduise how he might be imployed. Why, easily, quoth
hee, and greatly to your benefit: for men of my profession get by
schollers their whole liuing. What is your profession, sayd <i>Roberto</i>?
Truely, sir, said he, I am a player. A Player, quoth <i>Roberto</i>, I
tooke you rather for a gentleman of great liuing, for if by outward
habit men shuld be censured, I tell you you would be taken for a
substantiall / man. So am I, where I dwell (quoth the player), reputed
able at my proper cost to build a Windmill. What though the worlde
once went hard with mee, when I was faine to carrie my playing Fardle
a footebacke; <i>Tempora mutantur</i>, I know you know the meaning of it
better then I, but I thus conster it; it is otherwise now; for my very
share in playing apparrell will not be solde for two hundred pounds.
Truely (said <i>Roberto</i>) it is strange, that you should so prosper in
that vaine practise, for that it seemes to me your voyce is nothing
gracious. Nay then, said the player, I mislike your iudgement: why, I
am as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> famous for Delphrigus, and the king of Fairies, as euer was any
of my time. The twelue labors of <i>Hercules</i> haue I terribly thundred
on the stage, and placed three scenes of the deuill on the highway to
heauen. Haue ye so (said <i>Roberto</i>)? then I pray you pardon me. Nay,
more (quoth the player), I can serue to make a prettie speech, for I
was a countrie Author; passing at a morall, for it was I that pende the
Moral of mans wit, the Dialogue of Diues, and for seauen yeeres space
was absolute interpreter of the puppets. But now my Almanacke is out of
date.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The people make no estimation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Morrals teaching education.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Was not this prettie for a plaine rime extempore? if ye will ye shall
haue more. Nay it is enough, said <i>Roberto</i>, but how meane you to vse
mee? Why sir, in making playes, said the other, for which you shall be
well paied, if you will take the paines.</p>

<p><i>Roberto</i> perceiuing no remedie, thought best to respect of his present
necessity, to trie his wit, &amp; went with him willingly: who lodged him
at the townes end in a house of retaile, where what happened our Poet
you shall / heereafter heare. There, by conuersing with bad company, he
grew <i>A malo in peius</i>, falling from one vice to another, and so hauing
found a vaine to finger crownes he grew cranker then <i>Lucanio</i>, who
by this time began to droope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> being thus dealt withall by <i>Lamilia</i>.
She hauing bewitched him with her enticing wiles, caused him to
consume, in lesse then two yeares, that infinite treasure gathered
by his father with so many a poore mans curse. His lands sold, his
iewels pawnd, his money wasted, he was casseerd by <i>Lamilia</i> that
had coosened him of all. Then walked he like one of duke <i>Humfreys</i>
Squires, in a threedbare cloake, his hose drawne out with his heeles,
his shooes vnseamed, lest his feete should sweate with heate: now (as
witlesse as he was) hee remembred his fathers words, his kindnes to his
brother, his carelesnesse of himselfe. In this sorrow hee sate downe on
pennilesse bench; where, when <i>Opus</i> and <i>Vsus</i> told him by the chimes
in his stomacke it was time to fall vnto meate, he was faine with the
<i>Camelion</i> to feed vpon the aire, &amp; make patience his best repast.</p>

<p>While he was at his feast, <i>Lamilia</i> came flaunting by, garnished
with the iewels whereof she beguiled him: which sight serued to close
his stomacke after his cold cheere. <i>Roberto</i> hearing of his brothers
beggerie, albeit he had little remorse of his miserable state, yet did
he seeke him out, to vse him as a propertie, whereby <i>Lucanio</i> was
somewhat prouided for. But being of simple nature, hee serued but for
a blocke to whet <i>Robertoes</i> wit on; which the poore foole perceiuing,
he forsooke all other hopes of life, and fell to be a notorious Pandar:
in which detested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> course hee continued till death. But <i>Roberto</i>, now
famozed for an Arch-plaimaking-poet, his purse like the sea somtime
sweld, anon like the same sea / fell to a low ebbe; yet seldom he
wanted, his labors were so well esteemed. Marry this rule he kept,
what euer he fingerd aforehand was the certaine meanes to vnbinde a
bargaine, and being asked why he so sleightly dealt with them that did
him good? It becomes me, sa[i]th hee, to be contrarie to the worlde,
for commonly when vulgar men receiue earnest, they doe performe,
when I am paid any thing aforehand I breake my promise. He had shift
of lodgings, where in euery place his Hostesse writ vp the wofull
remembrance of him, his laundresse, and his boy; for they were euer
his in houshold, beside retainers in sundry other places. His companie
were lightly the lewdest persons in the land, apt for pilferie,
periurie, forgerie, or any villanie. Of these hee knew the casts to
cog at Cards, coosin at Dice: by these he learned the legerdemaines
of nips, foysters, conni-catchers, crosbyters, lifts, high Lawyers,
and all the rabble of that vncleane generation of vipers: and pithily
could he paint out their whole courses of craft: So cunning he was in
all crafts, as nothing rested in him almost but craftinesse. How often
the Gentlewoman his wife laboured vainely to recall him, is lamentable
to note: but as one giuen ouer to all lewdnes, he communicated her
sorrowful lines among his loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> truls, that iested at her bootelesse
laments. If he could any way get credite on scores, he would then
brag his creditors carried stones, comparing euerie round circle to
a groning O, procured by a painful burden. The shamefull ende of
sundry his consorts, deseruedly punished for their amisse, wrought no
compunction in his heart: of which one, brother to a Brothell he kept,
was trust vnder a tree as round as a Ball.</p>

<p>To some of his swearing companions thus it happened /: A crue of them
sitting in a Tauerne carowsing, it fortuned an honest Gentleman, and
his friend, to enter their roome: some of them being acquainted with
him, in their domineering drunken vaine, would haue no nay, but downe
he must needes sitte with them; beeing placed, no remedie there was,
but he must needes keep euen compasse with their vnseemely carrowsing.
Which he refusing, they fell from high wordes to sound strokes, so that
with much adoe the Gentleman saued his owne, and shifted from their
company. Being gone, one of these tiplers forsooth lackt a gold Ring,
the other sware they see the Gentleman take it from his hande. Upon
this the Gentleman was indited before a Judge: these honest men are
deposed: whose wisedome weighing the time of the braule, gaue light
to the Iury what power wine-washing poyson had: they, according vnto
conscience, found the Gentleman not guiltie, and God released by that
verdict the innocent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>With his accusers thus it fared: one of them for murther was worthily
executed: the other neuer since prospered: the third, sitting not long
after upon a lustie horse, the beast suddenly died vnder him: God amend
the man.</p>

<p><i>Roberto</i> euery day acquainted with these examples, was notwithstanding
nothing bettered, but rather hardened in wickednesse. At last was that
place iustified, God warneth men by dreams and visions in the night,
and by knowne examples in the day, but if he returne not, hee comes
vpon him with iudgement that shall bee felt. For now when the number
of deceites caused <i>Roberto</i> bee hatefull almost to all men, his
immeasurable drinking had made him the perfect Image of the dropsie,
and the loathsome scourge of Lust, tyrannized in his loues: / liuing in
extreame pouerty, and hauing nothing to pay but chalke, which now his
Host accepted not for currant, this miserable man lay comfortlessely
languishing, hauing but one groat left (the iust proporti&#333; of his
fathers Legacie) which looking on, he cried: O now it is too late, too
late to buy witte with thee: and therefore will I see if I can sell to
carelesse youth what I negligently forgot to buy.</p>

<p>Heere (Gentlemen) breake I off <i>Robertos</i> speech; whose life in most
parts agreeing with mine, found one selfe punishment as I haue doone.
Heereafter suppose me the said <i>Roberto</i>, and I will goe on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> that
hee promised: <i>Greene</i> will send you now his groatsworth of wit, that
neuer shewed a mitesworth in his life: and though no man now be by to
doe me good, yet, ere I die, I will by my repentance indeuor to doe all
men good.</p>

<p><i>O horrenda fames</i>, how terrible are thy assaultes? but <i>Vermis
conscientiæ</i>, more wounding are thy stings. Ah Gentlemen, that liue to
reade my broken and confused lines, looke not I should (as I was woont)
delight you with vain fantasies, but gather my follies altogether, and
as you would deale with so many parricides, cast them into the fire:
call them <i>Telegones</i>, for now they kill their father, and euerie lewd
line in them written is a deep piercing wound to my heart; euery idle
houre spent by any in reading them, brings a million of sorrowes to my
soule. O that the teares of a miserable man (for neuer any man was yet
more miserable) might wash their memorie out with my death; and that
those works with me together might be interd. But sith they cannot,
let this my last worke witnes against them with me, how I detest them.
Blacke is the remembrance of my blacke works, blacker then night,
blacker / then death, blacker then hell.</p>

<p>Learne wit by my repentance (Gentlemen), and let these fewe rules
following be regarded in your liues.</p>

<p>1. First in all your actions set God before your eies; for the feare
of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome: Let his word be a lanterne
to your feete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> and a light vnto your paths, then shall you stande as
firme rocks, and not be mocked.</p>

<p>2. Beware of looking backe: for God will not be mocked; of him that
hath receiued much, much shall be demanded.</p>

<p>3. If thou be single, and canst abstaine, turne thy eies from vanitie,
for there is a kinde of women bearing the faces of Angels, but the
hearts of Deuils, able to intrap the elect if it were possible.</p>

<p>If thou be m[a]rried, forsake not the wife of thy youth, to follow
strange flesh; for whoremongers and adulterers the Lord will iudge. The
doore of a Harlot leadeth downe to death, and in her lips there dwels
destruction; her face is decked with odors, but shee bringeth a man to
a morsell of bread and nakednesse: of which myselfe am instance.</p>

<p>5. If thou be left rich, remember those that want, and so deale, that
by thy wilfulnes thy self want not: Let not Tauerners and Victuallers
be thy Executors; for they will bring thee to a dishonorable graue.</p>

<p>6. Oppresse no man, for the crie of the wronged ascendeth to the eares
of the Lord; neither delight to encrease by Usurie, lest thou loose thy
habitation in the euerlasting Tabernacle.</p>

<p>7. Beware of building thy house to thy neighbours hurt; for the stones
will crie to the timber, We were laide together in bloud: and those
that so erect houses, calling / them by their names, shall lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> in the
graue like sheepe, and death shall gnaw vpon their soules.</p>

<p>8. If thou be poore, be also patient, and striue not to grow rich by
indirect meanes; for goods so gotten shall vanish away like smoke.</p>

<p>9. If thou be a father, maister, or teacher, ioyne good examples with
good counsaile; else little auaile precepts, where life is different.</p>

<p>10. If thou be a sonne or seruant, despise not reproofe; for though
correction be bitter at the first, it bringeth pleasure in the end.</p>

<p>Had I regarded the first of these rules, or beene obedient at the last:
I had not now, at my last ende, beene left thus desolate. But now,
though to my selfe I giue <i>Consilium post facta</i>; yet to others they
may serue for timely precepts. And therefore (while life giues leaue)
will send warning to my olde consorts, which haue liued as loosely as
myselfe, albeit weakenesse will scarce suffer me to write, yet to my
fellowe Schollers about this Cittie, will I direct these few insuing
lines.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>To those Gentlemen his Quondam acquaintance,<br />
that spend their wits in making Plaies, R. G.<br />
wisheth a better exercise, and wisdome<br />
to preuent his extremities.</i><br />
</p>

<p>If wofull experience may mooue you (Gentlemen) to beware, or vnheard
of wretchednes intreate you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> to take heed, I doubt not but you will
looke backe with sorrow on your time past, and endeuour with repentance
to spend that which is to come. Wonder not (for with thee wil I first
begin), thou famous gracer of Tragedians, that <i>Greene</i>, who hath
said with thee like the foole / in his heart, There is no God, should
now giue glorie vnto his greatnesse: for penitrating is his power,
his hand lies heauie vpon me, he hath spoken vnto me with a voice of
thunder, and I haue felt he is a God that can punish enimies. Why
should thy excellent wit, his gift, be so blinded, that thou shouldst
giue no glory to the giuer? Is it pestilent Machiuilian pollicie that
thou hast studied? O punish follie! What are his rules but meere
confused mockeries, able to extirpate in small time the generation of
mankinde. For if <i>Sic volo, sic iubeo</i>, hold in those that are able
to command: and if it be lawfull <i>Fas &amp; nefas</i> to doe any thing that
is beneficiall, onely Tyrants should possesse the earth, and they
striuing to exceede in tyranny, should each to other bee a slaughter
man; till the mightiest outliuing all, one stroke were left for Death,
that in one age man's life should ende. The brother of this Diabolicall
Atheisme is dead, and in his life had neuer the felicitie he aimed
at: but as he began in craft, liued in feare and ended in despaire.
<i>Quam inscrutabilia sunt Dei iudicia?</i> This murderer of many brethren
had his conscience seared like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> <i>Caine</i>: this betrayer of him that
gaue his life for him, inherited the portion of <i>Iudas</i>: this Apostata
perished as ill as <i>Iulian</i>: and wilt thou my friend be his Disciple?
Looke vnto me, by him perswaded to that libertie, and thou shalt finde
it an infernall bondage. I knowe the least of my demerits merit this
miserable death, but wilfull striuing against knowne truth, exceedeth
al the terrors of my soule. Defer not (with me) till this last point
of extremitie; for little knowest thou how in the end thou shalt be
visited.</p>

<p>With thee I ioyne young <i>Iuuenall</i>, that byting Satyrist, that lastlie
with mee together writ a Comedie. Sweete / boy, might I aduise thee,
be aduised, and get not many enemies by bitter words: inueigh against
vaine men, for thou canst do it, no man better, no man so wel: thou
hast a libertie to reprooue all, and none more; for one being spoken
to, all are offended, none being blamed no man is iniured. Stop shallow
water still running, it will rage, tread on a worme and it will turne:
then blame not schollers vexed with sharpe lines, if they reproue thy
too much libertie of reproofe.</p>

<p>And thou no lesse deseruing then the other two, in some things rarer,
in nothing inferiour; driuen (as my selfe) to extreame shifts, a little
haue I to say to thee: and were it not an idolatrous oth, I would
sweare by sweet <i>S. George</i>, thou art vnworthie better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> hap, sith thou
dependest on so meane a stay. Base minded men al three of you, if by
my miserie ye be not warned: for vnto none of you (like me) sought
those burres to cleaue: those Puppits (I meane) that speake from our
mouths, those Anticks garnisht in our colours. Is it not strange that
I, to whom they al haue beene beholding: is it not like that you, to
whome they all haue beene beholding, shall (were ye in that case that
I am now) be both at once of them forsaken? Yes, trust them not: for
there is an vpstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his
<i>Tygers heart wrapt in a Players hide</i>, supposes he is as well able to
bumbast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and being an absolute
<i>Iohannes fac totum</i>, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in
a countrie. O that I might intreate your rare wits to be imployed in
more profitable courses: &amp; let those Apes imitate your past excellence,
and neuer more acquaint them with your admired inuentions. I know the
best husband of you all will neuer proue an Usurer, and the kindest of
them / all will neuer prooue a kinde nurse: yet whilst you may, seeke
you better Maisters; for it is pittie men of such rare wits, should be
subiect to the pleasures of such rude groomes.</p>

<p>In this I might insert two more, that both haue writ against these
buckram Gentlemen: but let their owne works serue to witnesse against
their owne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> wickednesse, if they perseuer to mainteine any more such
peasants. For other new commers, I leaue them to the mercie of these
painted monsters, who (I doubt not) will driue the best minded to
despise them: for the rest, it skils not though they make a ieast at
them.</p>

<p>But now returne I againe to you [t]hree, knowing my miserie is to
you no news: and let me heartily intreate you to bee warned by my
harmes. Delight not (as I haue done) in irreligious oaths; for from
the blasphemers house a curse shall not depart. Despise drunkennes,
which wasteth the wit, and maketh men all equal vnto beasts. Flie
lust, as the deathsman of the soule, and defile not the Temple of
the holy ghost. Abhorre those Epicures, whose loose life hath made
religion lothsome to your eares: and when they sooth you with tearmes
of Mastership, remember <i>Robert Greene</i>, whome they haue so often
flattered, perishes now for want of comfort. Remember gentlemen, your
liues are like so many lighted Tapers, that are with care deliuered to
all of you to maintaine: these with wind-puft wrath may be extinguisht,
which drunkennes put out, which negligence let fall: for mans time of
itselfe is not so short, but it is more shortened by sin. The fire
of my light is now at the last snuffe, and the want of wherwith to
sustaine it, there is no substance left for life to feede on. Trust
not then (I beseech yee)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> to such weake staies: for they / are as
changeable in minde, as in many attires. Well, my hand is tired, and
I am forst to leaue where I would begin; for a whole booke cannot
containe these wrongs, which I am forst to knit vp in some few lines of

<i>Desirous that you should liue, though<br />
himselfe be dying,<br />
Robert Greene.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Now to all men I bid farewell in this sort, with this conceited Fable
of the olde Comedian <i>Æsope</i>.</p>

<p>An Ant and a Grashopper walking together on a greene, the one
carelessely skipping, the other carefully prying what winters prouision
was scattered in the way: the Grashopper scorning (as wantons wil) this
needelesse thrift (as he tearmed it) reprooued him thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The greedie miser thirsteth still for gaine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thrift is theft, his weale works others woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That foole is fond which will in caues remaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mongst faire sweetes he may at pleasure goe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this the Ant perceiuing the Grashoppers meaning, quickly replied:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The thriftie husband spares what vnthrifts spends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thrift no theft, for dangers to prouide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust to thy selfe, small hope in want yeeld friendes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A caue is better than the desarts wide.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>In short time these two parted, the one to his pleasure / the other to
his labour. Anon Haruest grewe on, and reft from the Grashopper his
woonted moysture. Then weakely skips he to the medows brinks: where
till fell winter he abode. But stormes continually powring, hee went
for succour to the Ant his olde acquaintance, to whome he had scarce
discouered his estate, but the little worme made this replie.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pack hence (quoth he) thou idle lazie worme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My house doth harbour no vnthriftie mates:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou scornedst to toile, and now thou feelst the storme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starust for foode while I am fed with cates.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vse no intreats, I will relentlesse rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For toyling labour hates an idle guest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Grashopper, foodlesse, helpelesse, and strengthlesse, got into the
next brooke, and in the yeelding sand digde himselfe a pit: by which
likewise he ingraued this Epitaph.</p>

<p>With this the grashopper yeelding to the weathers extremit[ie], died
comfortlesse without remedie. Like him myselfe: like me, shall al

<p class="center"><i>A letter written to his wife, found with this booke after his death.</i></p>

<p>The remembrance of many wrongs offered thee, and thy vnreprooued
virtues, adde greater sorrow to my miserable state then I can vtter or
thou conceiue. Neither is it lessened by consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> of thy absence
(though shame would let me hardly beholde thy face) but exceedingly
aggrauated, for that I cannot (as I ought) to thy owne selfe reconcile
my selfe, that thou mightest witnesse my inward woe at this instant,
that haue made thee a wofull wife for so long a time. But equal heauen
hath denied that comfort, giuing at my last neede / like succour as I
haue sought all my life: being in this extremitie as voide of helpe
as thou hast beene of hope. Reason would, that after so long waste,
I should not send thee a childe to bring thee greater charge; but
consider he is the fruit of thy wombe, in whose face regard not the
fathers faults so much as thy owne perfections. He is yet Greene, and
may grow straight, if he be carefully tended: otherwise apt enough (I
feare me) to follow his fathers folly. That I haue offended thee highly
I knowe; that thou canst forget my iniuries I hardly beleeue: yet
perswade I my selfe if thou saw my wretched state thou couldest not but
lament it: nay, certainely I knowe thou wouldest. Al my wrongs muster
themselues about me, euery euill at once plagues me. For my contempt
of God, I am contemned of men: for my swearing and forswearing, no man
will beleeue me: for my gluttony, I suffer hunger: for my drunkennesse,
thirst: for my adulterie, vlcerous sores. Thus God hath cast me downe,
that I might be humbled: and punished me for example of others sinne:
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> although he suffers me in this world to perish without succour,
yet trust I in the world to come to finde mercie, by the merits of my
Sauiour, to whome I commend this, and commit my soule.</p>

<p>(<i>Characters of Gabriel Harvey and accounts of his quarrel with the
Marlowe group, and Nash in particular, will be found in all histories
of Elizabethan literature, and also elsewhere. The war of pamphlets
between Harvey and Nash was a very furious word-battle, and its two
chief monuments</i>, Pierce's Supererogation <i>and</i> Have with you to
Saffron Walden, <i>are as choice examples of scurrility as can easily be
found. But both are very long, and as I have set my heart on giving
whole pamphlets, I have preferred Harvey's</i> Precursor <i>and Nash's</i>
Prognostication. <i>The former is a sort of pilot engine to</i> Pierce's
Supererogation, <i>published first before and then with the longer
piece, and for all its brevity intensely characteristic of Harvey&mdash;the
incarnation of the donnishness of his time, and also of a certain
side of the Elizabethan man of letters generally. The latter, though
evidently composed in direct imitation of Rabelais, of whom Nash was
certainly a reader, was indirectly an attack on the Harveys, one of
whom, Gabriel's brother Richard, was a great astrologer.</i>)</p>

Thorius, M. Antony Chewt, and euery fauorable Reader.</i></a></p>


<p>Louing M. Barnabe, M. Iohn, and M. Antony (for the rest of my partiall
C&#333;menders must pardon me, till the Print be better acquainted with
their names), I haue lately receiued your thrise-curteous Letters,
with the Ouerplus of your thrise-sweet Sonets annexed: the liberallest
giftes, I beleeue, that euer you bestowed vpon so slight occasion,
and the very prodigallest fruites of your floorishing wittes. Whose
onely default is, not your, but my default, that the matter is
nothing correspondent to the manner; and miselfe must either grosely
forget miselfe, or franckly acknowledge mi simple selfe an vnworthy
subiect of so worthy commendations. Which I cannot read without
blushing, repeate without shame, or remember without griefe, that I
come so exceeding-short in so excessiue great accountes; the summes
of your rich largesse, not of my poore desert; and percase deuised
to aduertise me what I should be, or to signifie what you wish [me]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to be; not to declare what I am, or to insinuate what I may be.
Eloquence, and Curtesie were euer bountifull in the amplifying veine:
and it hath bene reputed a frendly Pollicy, to encourage their louing
acquaintance to labour the attainement of those perfections, which
they blason in them, as already atcheiued. Either some such intention
you haue, by / way of Stratageme, to awaken my negligence, or enkindle
my confidence; or you are disposed by way of Ciuility, to make me
vnreasonably beholding vnto you for your extreme affection. Which I
must either leaue vnrequited; or recompense affection with affection,
&amp; recommende me vnto you with your owne Stratageme, fitter to animate
fresher spirites, or to whet finer edges. Little other vse can I, or
the world reape of those great-great commendations, wherewith you,
and diuers other Orient wittes haue newly surcharged me, by tendring
so many kinde Apologies in my behalfe, and presenting so many sharpe
inuectiues against my aduersaries: vnlesse also you purposed to make me
notably ashamed of my c&#333;fessed insufficiency, guilty of so manifold
imperfecti&#333;s, in respect of the least semblance of those imputed
singularities. Whatsoeuer your intendment in an ouerflowing affection
was, I am none of those, that greedily surfet of selfe-conceit, or
sottishly hugge their owne babyes. <i>Narcissus</i> was a fayre boy,
but a boy: <i>Suffenus</i> a noble braggard, but a braggard: <i>Nestor</i> a
sweet-tongued old-man, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> an Old-man: and <i>Tully</i> (whom I honour in
his vertues, and excuse in his ouersightes) an eloquent Selfe-loouer,
but a Selfe-loouer. He that thought to make himselfe famous with his
ouerweening and brauing <i>Il'e, Il'e, Il'e</i>, might perhaps nourrish an
aspiring imagination to imitate his <i>Ego, Ego, Ego</i>, so gloriously
reiterated in his gallant Orations. Some smirking minions are fine
fellowes in their owne heades, and some cranke Princockes iolly men
in their owne humours: as desperate in resolution, as the dowtiest
ranke of Errant knightes; and as coye in phantasie, as the nicest sort
of simpring damosels, that in their owne glasses find no creature so
bewtifull, or amiable, as their delitious selues. I haue beheld, / &amp;
who hath not seene some lofty conceites, towring very high, &amp; coying
themselues sweetly on their owne amounting winges, young feathers
of old Icarus? The gay Peacocke is woondrously inamored vpon the
glittering fanne of his owne gorgious taile, and weeneth himselfe
worthy to be crowned the Prince of byrdes, and to be enthronished in
the chaire of supreme excellency. Would Christ, the greene Popiniay,
with his newfangled iestes, as new as Newgate, were not asmuch to say,
as his owne Idol. Queint wittes must haue a Priuiledge to prank-vp
their dainty limmes, &amp; to fawne vpon their owne tricksie deuises. But
they that vnpartially know themselues, seuerely examine their owne
abilities; vprightly counterpoise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> defectes with sufficiencies; frankly
confesse the greatest part of their knowledge to be the least part
of their ignorance; aduisedly weigh the difficulties of the painfull
and toylesome way, the hard maintenance of credit easely gotten, the
impossible satisfaction of vnsatisfiable expectation, the vncertaine
ficklenesse of priuate Phantasie, &amp; the certaine brittlenesse of
publique Fame; are not lightly bewitched with a fonde doting vpon
their owne plumes. And they that deepely consider vpon the weakenesse
of inward frailty, the casualtie of outward fortune, the detraction
of Enuie, the virulency of Malice, the counter-pollicy of Ambition,
and a hundred-hundred empeachments of growing reputation: that aswell
diuinely, as philosophically haue learned to looue the gentlenesse of
Humanity, to embrace the mildnesse of Modestie, to kisse the meekenesse
of Humilitie, to loath the odiousnesse of Pride, to assuage the
egreness of Spite, to preuent the vengeance of Hatred, to reape the
sweet fruites of Temperance, to tread the smooth Path of Securitie, to
take the firme course of Assuraunce, / and to enioy the felicitie of
Contentment: that iudiciously haue framed themselues to carry Mindes,
like their Bodies, and Fortunes, as apperteineth vnto them, that
would be loth to ouerreach in presumptuous conceit: they I say, and
all they that would rather vnderly the reproche of obscuritie, then
ouercharge their mediocritie with an illusiue opinion of extraordinary
furni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ture, and I wott not what imaginarie complementes: are readier,
and a thousand times readier, to returne the greatest Prayses, where
they are debt, then to accept the meanest, where they are almes. And
I could nominate some, that in effect make the same reckoning of
Letters, Sonets, Orations, or other writinges commendatory, that they
do of meate without nourishment, of hearbes without vertue, of plants
without fruite; of a lampe without oyle, a linke without light, or a
fier without heate. Onely some of vs are not so deuoide of good manner,
but we conceiue what belongeth to ciuill duty, and will euer be prest
to interteine Curtesie with curtesie, &amp; to requite any frendship with
frendship: vnfainedly desirous, rather to recompense in deedes, then to
glose, or paint in wordes. You may easely persuade me to publish, that
was long sithence finished in writing, and is now almost dispatched
in Print: (the amendes must be addressed in some other more materiall
Treatise, or more formal Discourse: and haply <i>Nashes S. Fame</i> may
supply some defectes of Pierces Supererogation:) but to suffer your
thrise-affectionate Letters and Sonets, or rather your thrise lauish
beneuolences to be published, which so farre surmount not onely the
mediocrity of my present endeuour, but euen the possibility of any my
future emproouement; I could not be persuaded by any eloquence, or
importunacy in the world, were I not as monstrously / reuiled by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
other without reason, as I am excessively extolled by you without
cause. In which case he may seeme to a discreet enemy excusable, to
an indifferent frend iustifiable, that is not transported with his
owne passion, but relyeth on the iudgement of the learnedest, and
referreth himselfe to the Practise of the wisest. In the one, esteeming
<i>Plutarch</i> or <i>Homer</i> as an hundred Autors: in the other, valuing
<i>Cato</i>, or <i>Scipio</i>, as a thousand Examples. I neuer read, or heard of
any respectiue, or considerate person, vnder the degree of those that
might reuenge at pleasure, contemne with autority, assecure themselues
from common obloquy, or commande publique reputation (mighty men may
finde it a Pollicy, to take a singular, or extraordinary course), so
carelesse of his owne credit, so recklesse of the present time, so
senselesse of the posterity, so negligent in occurents of consequence,
so dissolute in his proceedings, so prodigall of his name, so deuoide
of all regarde, so bereft of common sense, so vilely base, or so hugely
hawtie of minde; that in case of infamous imputation, or vnworthy
reproch, notoriously scattered-abroad, thought it not requisite, or
rather necessary, to stand vpon his owne defence according to Equity,
and euen to labour his owne commendation according to the presented
occasion. Discourses yeeld plenty of Reasons: and Histories affourde
store of Examples. It is no vain-glory to permit with consideration,
that abused Modesty hath affected with discretion. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> vanity to
controwle, that true honour hath practised: and folly to condemne, that
right wisedome hath allowed. If any dislike Immodesty indeede, despise
vanity indeede, reprooue Arrogancy indeede, or loath Vainglory indeede;
I am as forward with Tongue and Hart as the foremost of the forwardest:
and were / my pen answerable, perhaps at occasion it should not greatly
lagge behinde. To accomplish, or aduaunce any vertuous purpose (sith it
is now enforced to be sturring), it might easely be entreated, euen to
the vttermost extent of that little-little Possibility, wherewith it
hath pleased the Greatest to endowe it. Howbeit Curtesie is as ready
to ouerloade with prayse as Malice eger to ouerthrow with reproch.
Both ouershoote, as the manner is; but malice is the Diuell. For my
poore part, I hope the One shall do me as little harme as fayre weather
in my iorney: I am suer, the other hath done me more good, then was
intended, and shall neuer puddle or annoy the course of the cleere
running water. Albeit I haue studied much, and learned little: yet
I haue learned to gleane some handfulls of corne out-of the rankest
cockle: to make choice of the most fragrant flowers of <i>Humanitie</i>,
the most vertuous hearbes of <i>Philosophie</i>, the most soueraine fruites
of <i>Gouernment</i>, and the most heauenly manna of <i>Diuinitie</i>: to be
acquainted with the fayrest, prouided for the fowlest, delighted with
the temperatest, pleased with the meanest, and contented with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<i>weather</i>. Greater men may professe, and can atchieue greater matters:
I thanke God I know the l&#275;gth, that is, the shortnes of mine owne
foote. If it be any mans pleasure to extenuate my suffici&#275;cy in
other knowledge, or practise, to empeach my ability in wordes, or
deedes, to debase my fortune, to abridge my commendations, or to
annihilate my fame, he shall finde a cold aduersary of him that hath
layed hoat passions awatering, and might easely be induced to be the
Inuectiue of his owne Non-proficiency. Onely he craueth leaue to
estimate his credit, and to value his honesty, as behooueth euery
man, that regardeth any good: and if withall it be his / vnfained
request, that Order should repeale disorder; moderation restraine
licentiousnesse; discretion abandon vanity; mildnesse assuage
choller; meeknesse alay arrogancy; consideration reclaime rashnesse;
indifferency attemper passion; Curtesie mitigate, Charity appease, &amp;
Vnity attone debate: pardon him. Or, in case nothing will preuaile
with fury but fury, and nothing can winne desired amity but pretended
hostility, that must driue-out one naile with another, &amp; beat-away
one wedge with another, according to the Latin Prouerbe: Pardon him
also, that in the resolution of a good minde, will commaund, what he
cannot entreat; and extort, what he cannot persuade. That little may
be done with no great adoo: and, seeing it may as surely, as easely be
done, I am humbly to beseech established Wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>dome, to winke at one
experiment of aduenturous Folly; neuer before embarked in any such
acti&#333;, and euer to eschewe the like with a chary regard, where any
other mediation may purchase redresse. I will not vrge what conniuence
hath been noted in as disfauorable cases: it is sufficient for me to
pleade mine own acquittall. Other prayse he affecteth not, that in a
deepe insight into his innermost partes findeth not the highest pitch
of his Hope equiualent to the lowest pit of your commendation. And
if by a gentle construction, or a fauorous encouragement, he seemeth
any thing in others opinion, that is nothing in his owne Censure, the
lesser his merite, the greater their mercy; and the barrainer his
desert, the frutefuller your liberality. Whose vnmeasurable prayses I
am to interpret, not as they may seeme in some bounteous conceit, but
as they are in mine owne knowledge; good wordes, but vnfitly applied;
frendly beneuolences, but wastfully bestowed; gallant amplifications,
but slenderly deser/ued: what but termes of Ciuility, or fauours of
Curtesie, or hyperboles of Looue: whose franke allowance I shall not be
able to earne with the study of twenty yeares more: in briefe, nothing
but partiall witnesses, preiudicate iudgements, idle preambles, and
in effect meere wordes. And euen so as I found them, I leaue them.
Yet let me not dismisse so extensiue curtesie with an empty hand.
Whatsoeuer I am (that am the least little of my thoughtes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> and the
greatest contempt of mine owne hart), <i>Parthenophill</i> and <i>Parthenophe</i>
embellished, the <i>Spanish Counsellour</i> Inglished, and <i>Shores Wife</i>
eternised; shall euerlastingly testifie what you are: go forward in
maturity, as ye haue begun in pregnancy, and behold <i>Parthenopoeus</i>
the sonne of the braue Meleager, <i>Homer</i> himselfe, and of the swift
Atalanta <i>Calliope</i> herselfe: be thou, Barnabe, the gallant Poet, like
Spencer, or the valiant souldiour, like Baskeruile; and euer remember
thy <i>French seruice</i> vnder the braue Earl of Essex. Be thou, Iohn, the
many-tongued Linguist, like Andrewes, or the curious Intelligencer,
like Bodley; and neuer forget <i>thy Netherlandish traine</i> vnder Him,
that taught the Prince of Nauarre, now the valorous king of Fraunce. Be
thou Antony, the flowing Oratour, like Dooue, or the skilfull Heralde,
like Clarentius; and euer remember <i>thy Portugall voyage</i> vnder Don
Antonio. The beginning of vertuous Proceedings is the one halfe of
honorable actions. Be yourselues in hope, and what yourselues desire in
effect: and I haue attained some portion of my request. For you cannot
wish so exceeding-well vnto me, but I am as ready with tongue, and
minde, to wish a great-deale better vnto you, and to reacquite you with
a large vsury of most-affectionate prayers, recommending you to the
diuine giftes and gratious blessings of Heauen.</p>

<p>May / it please the fauorable Reader, to voutsafe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> me the Curtesie of
his Patience, vntill he hath thoroughly perused the whole Discourse
at his howers of leysure (for such scriblings are hardly worth the
vacantest howers): I am not to importune him any farther; but would
be glad he might finde the Whole lesse tedious in the end, then some
Parts in the beginning, or midst; or, at-least, that one peece might
helpe to furnish-out amendes for an other. And so taking my leaue with
the kindest Farewell of a most thankfull minde, I desist from wearying
him with a tedious Preface, whom I am likely to tire with so many
superfluous Discourses. Howbeit might it happely please the sweetest
Intercessour to ensweeten the bitterest gall of Spite, and to encalme
the roughest tempest of Rage, I could cordially wish that <i>Nashes
S. Fame</i> might be the Period of my Inuectiues: and <i>the excellent
Gentlewoman</i>, my patronesse, or rather Championesse in this quarrel, is
meeter by nature, and fitter by nurture, to be an enchaunting Angell,
with her white quill, then a tormenting Fury with her blacke inke. It
remaineth at the election of one, whom God indue with more discretion.</p>

<p>Sweet M. Doctour Haruey (for I cannot intitule you with an Epithite of
lesse value then that which the Grecian and Roman Oratours ascribed
to Theophrastus, in respect of so many your excellent labours,
garnished with the garland of matchlesse Oratory): if at any time
either the most earnest persuasion of a deare frend, and vnusually
most deare, and constant, adiured therevnto by the singular vertue
of your most prayse-worthy, and vnmatchable wit: or the woonderful
admiration of your peerlesse conceit, embraued with so many gorgeous
ornamentes of diuine Rhetorique:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> or the doubtlesse successive benefit
thereof, deuoted to the glory of our English Eloquence, and our
vulgar Tuscanisme (if I may so terme it); may worke any plausible or
respectiue motions with you to bewtifie, and enrich our age, with those
most praise-moouing workes, full of gallantest discourse, and reason,
which I vnderstand by some assured intelligence be now glowing vpon
the anvile, ready to receiue the right artificiall forme of diuinest
workem&#257;ship: th&#275; let I beseech you, nay, by all our mutuall
frendships I coniure you (loue and admiration of them arming me with
the placarde of farther confidence) those, and other your incomparable
writings, speedily, or rather pre/sently, shew th&#275;selues in the
shining light of the Sunne. That, by this Publication of so rare,
&amp; rich Discourses, our English Rauens, the spitefull enemyes to
all birdes of more bewtifull wing, and more harmonious note then
themselues, may shroude themselues in their nests of basest obscurity,
&amp; keepe hospitality with battes, and owles, fit consorts for such
vile carions. Good Sir, arise, and confound those Viperous Cryticall
monsters, and those prophane Atheistes of our Commonwealth; which
endeuour with their mutinous and Serpentine hissing, like geese, not
to arme the Senatours and Oratours of Rome, but to daunt, astonish,
and, if it were possible, to ouerthrow them. And sithence the very
thunder-lightning of your admirable Eloquence is suffici&#275;tly
auailable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> strike them with a lame Palsie of tongue (if they be not

ensewe such contagious Catharres and Reumes, as I am priuy some of
them haue been grieuously disseased withall), misse not, but hitt them
seurly home, as they deserue with Supererogation. You haue bene reputed
euermore, since first I heard of you in Oxford and elsewhere, to haue
bene as much giuen to fauour, commende, and frequent such as were
approoued, or toward in learning, witt, kinde behauiour, or any good
quality, as may be required in any man of your demerit: an vndoubted
signe, how much you loath Inuectiues or any needeles cont&#275;tions.
I would (as many your affectionate fr&#275;ds would) it had bene your
fortune to haue encountred some other Paranymphes, then such as you are
now to discipline: most vnwillingly, I perceiue, but most necessarily,
&amp; not without especiall consideration, being so manifestly vrged,
and grosely prouoked to defend yourselfe. But you haue ere now bene
acquainted / with patience perforce: and I hope the most desperate
swasher of them will one day learne to shew himself honester or wiser.
And thus recommending your sweete endeuours, with your grauer studies,
to the highest treasury of heauenly Muses; I right hartely take my
leaue with a Sonnet of that Muse, that honoreth the Vrany of du Bartas,
and yourselfe: of du Bartas elsewhere; here of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> whose excellent

worthy personages, deserue immortall commendation. I thanke him very

<p><span class="smcap">Curteous</span> Gentlemen, it seemed good to M. Doctour Haruey,
for breuity-sake, and because he liked not ouer-long Preambles, or
Postambles, to short discourses, to omit the commendatorie Letters,

frendes of London, and both the Vniuersities. Which neuerthelesse, are
reserued to be prefixed, inserted, or annexed, either in his <i>defensiue

in his <i>Discourses of Nashes S. Fame</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> already finished, &amp; presently
to be published, as these shall like their interteinement: of whose
fauorable &amp; plausible Welcome, diuers learned and fine wittes haue
presumed the best. Howbeit finally it was thought not amisse, vpon
conference with some his aduised acquaintance, to make choice of some
two or three of the reasonablest, and temperatest Sonnets (but for
variety, &amp; to auoyde tediousnesse in the entrance, rather to be annexed
in the end, then prefixed in the beginning of the present Discourses):
one of the foresayd M. Thorius, an other of M. Chewt, and the third
of a learned French gentleman, Monsieur Fregeuill Gautius, who hath
published some weighty Treatises, aswell Politique as Religious,
both in Latin and French; and hath acquainted M. Doctour Haruey with
certaine most profitable Mathematicall deuises of his own inuention.

whom I humbly recommende to your curteous Censure, and so rest from

<p><span class="smcap">Sitting</span> Gentlemen vpon Douer cliffes, to quaint my selfe with
the art of Navigation, and knowe the course of the Tides, as the Danske
Crowes gather on the Sandes against a storme: so there appeared on the
downs such a flock of knaues, that, by Astrological coniectures, I
began to gather that this yeere would proue intemperate by an extreme
heat in S&#333;mer, insomuch that the stones in Cheap side should be so
hot, that diuers persons should feare to goe from Poules to the Counter
in the Poultrye: whereupon I betook me to my Ephimerides, and erecting
a figure, haue found such strange accidents to fall out this yeere,
Mercury being Lord and predominate in the house of Fortune, that many
fooles shall haue full cofers, and wise men walke vp and downe with
empty pursses: that if Iupiter were not ioyned with him in a fauourable
aspect, the Butchers / of East-cheape should doo little or nothing all
Lent but make prickes: seeing therefore the wonders that are like to
fall out this present yeere, I haue for the benefit of my Countrymen
taken in hand to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> this Prognostication, discoursing breefelye of
the Eclipses both of Sunne and Moone, with their dangerous effectes
like to followe, which if God preuent not, many poore men are like to
fast on Sondaies for want of food, and such as haue no shooes to goe
barefoot, if certaine deuout Coblers proue not the more curteous: but
yet Astrologie is not so certaine but it may fayle: and therfore diuers
Hostesses shall chaulke more this yeere then their Guests wil wipe out:

<p class="ph4"><i>Of the Eclipses that shall happen this present yeere, to the great and
fearfull terrifying of the beholders.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> <i>we may credit</i> the authenticall censures of Albumazan
and Ptolomey, about the motions of celestiall bodies, whose influence
dooth exitat and procure continuall mutability in the lower region:
we shal finde y<sup>t</sup> the Moon this yeere shall be eclipsed, which shall
happen in one of y<sup>e</sup> 12 moneths, &amp; some of the foure / quarters of
the yeere, whose pointes as they shall be totallye darkened, so the
effectes shall be wondrous and strange. For Cancer being the sole house
of the Moone, dooth presage that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> yeere fruits shall be greatly
eaten with Catterpillers: as Brokers, Farmers, and Flatterers, which
feeding on the sweate of other mens browes, shall greatlye hinder the
beautye of the spring, and disparage the growth of all hottest hearbes,
vnlesse some northerly winde of Gods veng&#257;ce cleere the trees of
such Catterpillers, with a hotte plague and the pestilence: but Cancer
being a watrie signe and cheefe gouernour of flouds and streams, it
foresheweth that Fishmongers if they be not well lookt to, shall goe
downe as farre as Graues end in Wherries and forestall the market, to
the great preiudice of the poore, that all Lent ground their fare on
the benefit of Salte fishe and red herring: besides it signifieth that
Brewers shal make hauocke of Theames water, and put more liquour then
they were accustomed amongst their Maulte: to the ouerthrowe of certain
crased Ale knights, whose morning draughtes of strong Beere is a great
staye to their stomacks: a lamentable case if it be not lookt into and
preuented by some speedye supplication to the woorshipfull order of
ale cunners. / But in this we haue great hope that because the effects
cannot surprise the cause, diuers Tapsters shall trust out more then
they can get in: and although they fill their Pots but halfe full, yet
for want of true dealing die in the Brewers debt.</p>

<p>Thus much for the watry signe of Cancer, and because this Eclipse is
little visible in our horison, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> passe it ouer with this prouiso to
all seafaring men, to cary more shirts then one with them a ship boord,
lest to their great labor they spend many houres in murthering their
vermin on the hatches.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Eclipse of the Sunne.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Eclipse of the Sun according to Proclus opinion is like
to produce many hot and pestilent infirmities, especiallie amongst
Sumners and Petti-foggers, whose faces being combust with many fiery
inflamatiues shall shew y<sup>e</sup> dearth, that by their deuout drinking is
like to ensue of Barly, if violent death take not away such c&#333;suming
mault worms: diuers are like to be troubled with such hotte rewmes in
their heads, that their haire shall fall off: and such hot agues shall
raigne this yeere, with strange feuers and calamaties, that / if the
Sunne were not placed in a colde signe, Renish wine would rise to ten
pence a quarte before the latter end of August: but diuers good Planets
being retrog[r]ade, foretelleth that Lemmans this yeere shalbe plenty,
insomuch that many shall vse them to bedward, for the quallifying of
their hot and inflamed stomackes. And Mars being placed neere vnto
the Sunne sheweth that there shalbe a great death among people: olde
women that can liue no longer shall dye for age: and yong men that haue
Vsurers to their father, shal this yeer haue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> great cause to laugh, for
the Deuill hath made a decree, that after they are once in hell, they
shall neuer rise againe to trouble their executors: Beside that by all
coniecturall argumentes the influence of Mars shall be so violent, that
diuers souldiers in partes beyond the seas, shall fall out for want
of their paye, and heere in our meridionall clyme, great quarrelles
shall be raised between man and man, especially in cases of Law: gentry
shall goe check-mate with Iustice, and coyne out countenance oft-times
equitie: the poore sitting on pennylesse benche, shall sell their
Coates to striue for a strawe, and Lawyers laugh such fooles to scorne
as cannot keep their crownes in their pursses.</p>

<p>Further, there is like to be great falling out amongst / Church men
and certaine fond sects of religion like to trouble the commons: selfe
conceipters and ouer holy counterfeites that delight in singularitie,
shall rise vp and despise authoritie, presuming euen to abuse the
higher powers, if Saturne with a frowning influence, did not threaten
them with Tibornes consequence. But whereas the Sun is darkned but by
digits, and that vpon y<sup>e</sup> south points, it presageth great miseries
to Spain and those Southerly Countries: Friers and Monks shal heat
them so this yeer with confessing of Harlots, that their crownes
shall wax balde of the one accord, to the great impouerishing of the
Spanish Barbers: Surgeons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> Spain shall wax rich, and their Hospitals
poore: such a pestilent mortallitie is like to fall amongst those
hipocriticall massemongers. The Dukes, Marquesses &amp; Counties shall
haue their dublets closed with such Spanish buttons, that they shal
neuer proue good quiresters, for the hotte and inflamed rewmes fallen
down into their throats: It is further to be feared, that because the
Eclipse hapneth in Iulye, there will through the extrem heat grow such
abund&#257;ce of Fleas, that women shall not goe to bed before twelue a
clocke at night, for the great murthers and stratagems they are like to
commit vpon those little animalls.</p>

<p>And whereas this Eclipse falleth out at three of the clocke in the
afternoone, it foresheweth that manye shall goe soberer into Tauernes
then they shall come out: and that he which drinkes hard and lyes
cold, shal neuer dye of the sweate, although Gemini combust and
retrog[r]ade, sheweth that some shall haue so sore a sweating, that
they may sell their haire by the pound to stuffe Tennice balles: but
if the Beadelles of Bridewell be carefull this Summer, it may be hoped
that Peticote lane may be lesse pestered with ill aires then it was
woont: and the houses there so cleere clensed, that honest women may
dwell there without any dread of the whip and the carte: and I finde
that the altitude of that place and of Shordich are all one eleuated,
and 2 degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> and vnder the zenith or verticall point of Venus, which
presageth that sundry sorts of men and women shall be there resident:
some shalbe so short heeld &amp; so quesie stomackt that they shal ly in
their beds while noon, by which means they shal grow so ful of grosse
humors, that they shalbe troubled with strange timpanies &amp; swellings in
their bellies, vncurable for fortye weekes vntill they be helped by the
aduice of some skilfull Midwife.</p>

<p>Besides, other of the same sex and faction, / shall learn to cosin
young nouices, and fetch in young Gentlemen, to the great ouerthrow
of youth, if some sharpe and speedye redresse be not fetcht from the
woorshipfull Colledge of the Phisitians in the parrish of S. Brides.
But heere by the waye gentle Reader, note that this Eclipse sheweth,
that this yeer shall be some strange birthes of Children produced in
some monstrous forme, to the greefe of the Parentes, and fearefull
spectackle of the beholders: but because the Eclipse chaunseth
Southerlye, it is little to be feared that the effectes shall fail
in England: yet somewhat it is to bee doubted, that diuers Children
shall be borne, that when they come to age shall not knowe their owne
Fathers: others shall haue their fingers of [t]he nature of Lyme
twigges, to get most parte of their liuing with fiue and a reache: some
shall be born with feet like vnto Hares, that they shal run so swift,
that they shall neuer tarry with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> maister, but trudge from poste to
piller, till they take vp beggars bush for their lodging: Others shall
haue Noses like Swine, that there shall not be a feast within a myle,
but they shall smell it out: But especiallye it is to be doubted, that
diuers women this yeere shall bee borne with two tungs, to the terrible
greefe of such as shall marry them, vttering / in their furye such
rough cast eloquence, that knaue and slaue shalbe but holyday woords
to their husbands. And whereas this fearefull Eclipse dooth continue
but an houre and a halfe, it signifieth that this yeere womens loue to
their husbands shall be very shorte, some so momentarye, that it shall
scarce continue from the Church doore to the wedding house: and that
Hennes, Capons, Geese, and other pullin shall little haunt poore mens
tables, but flye awaye with spittes in their bellies to fatte Churlles
houses, that pamper themselues vp with delicates and dainties: although
very fewe other effectes are to be prognosticated, yet let me giue this
caueat to my Countrymen, as a clause to this wonderfull Eclipse. Let
such as haue clothes enow, keep themselues warme from taking of colde:
and I would wishe rich men all this winter to sit by a good fire, and
hardlye to goe to bed without a Cuppe of Sack, and that so qualified
with Suger, that they proue not rewmatick: let them feede daintilye
and take ease enough, and no doubt according to the iudgement of
Albumazar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> they are like to liue as long as they can, and not to dye
one hower before their time.</p>

<p>Thus much for this strange Eclipse of the Sunne.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Of / the second Eclipse of the Moone, which is like to fall out when
it chaunseth either before the</i> 31. <i>of December or els not at all,
this present yeere.</i> 1591.</p>

<p>The second Eclipse of the Moon shalbe but little seene in England,
wherevpon the effectes shall be nothing preiuditiall to our clyme: yet
as the bodye of the Moone is neuer obscure in part or in whole, but
some dangerous euents doo followe: so I meane to set downe breefely
what is to be lookte for in these westerne partes of the worlde.</p>

<p>First therefore it is to bee feared, that the Danes shall this yeere
bee greatly giuen to drincke, insomuch that English Beere shall there
be woorth fiue pence a stoape, that their Hoffes and tappe houses shall
be more frequented then the Parishe Churches, and many shall haue more
Spruce Beere in their bellies, then wit in their heads: wherevpon shall
/ growe Apoplexies and colde palsies in their legges, that they shall
diuers times not bee able to stand on their feete. Vpon this shall
growe great commoditye to the Potters and Glasse makers, for it is
like there shall be a great ouerthrowe of them, if there bee not some
act made for drinking in blacke Jackes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> But if the weather prooue
seasonable, and the Haruest great, and the Barnes full of Corne: Rye
is like to be cheap in Denmarke, and bread to be of a reasonable size,
for the releeuing of the poore. Mar[r]y, Fraunce is like to haue a
great dearth of honest men, if the king preuaile not against these
mutenous Rebelles of the League, and Papists in diuers places to be
plentye, if God or the King rout them not out with a sharpe ouerthrow:
But this hope we haue against that rascall rabble of those shauelings,
that there was found in an olde booke this Prophecie spoken about
Jerusalem long since by a Jew: The tree that God hath not planted
shall be pulled vp by the roots: some curious Astronomers of late
dayes that are more Propheticall than Juditiall, affirme that Martin
the kill-hog for his deuout drincking (by the Pope canonized a Saint)
shall rise againe in the apparell of a Minister, and tickle some of
the baser sorte with such lusty humors in their braines, that / diuers
selfe conceited fooles shal become his disciples, and grounding their
witlesse opinion on an heriticall foundation, shall seeke to ruinate
authoritie, and peruert all good orders established in the Church, to
the great preiudice of vnity and religion, tituling th&#275;selues by the
names of Martinistes, as the Donatists grew from Donates: were it not
that the Moone being in Taurus, which gouernes the neck and throat,
shewes that the Squinancie shall raigne amongst them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> diuers for
want of breath dye of the strangling. Now for that Capricornus is a
signe wherein Luna is often resident, it prognosticateth a great death
amongst hornde beasts. The Butchers shall commit wilfull murther vpon
Sheepe and Oxen, and diuers Keepers kill store of Buckes, and reserue
no other fees to their selues but the hornes, insomuche that if the
Person of Horne-Church in Essex take not heede, there maye hap to
prooue this yeere some Cuckoldes in his Parrish.</p>

<p>But there is like to bee concluded by an act set downe in Grauesende
Barge, that hee that wypes his Nose and hath it not, shall forfeite his
whole face, and that all such as are iealous ouer their wiues without
cause, are worthie to bee punisht with / the horne plague for their
labour. And whereas this Eclipse is farre from the signe Pisces, it
shewes that there shall bee much stinking fish this yere at Billings
gate, and that Quinborowe oyster boates shall ofte times carrie knaues
as wel as honest men: but let the Fish-wiues take heed, for if most of
them proue not scoldes, yet because Pisces is a signe that gouernes the
feete, they shall weare out more shooes in Lent then in anie two months
beside through the whole yeere, and get their liuing by walking and
crying, because they slaundered Ram alley with such a tragical infamie.
The rest I conceale as friuolous, and little necessarie to be touched
in this Prognostication.</p>

<p><i>A declaration of the generall disposition of sundrie conceited
qualities incident vnto mens mindes &amp; natures throughout these foure
quarters of the yere, by the merrie influence of the Planets, with some
other tragicall euents and obseruations worthie the noting, contayned
vnder each seperated reuolution.</i></p>

<p><i>And first of the inclination of the Winter quarter.</i></p>

<p>Winter / the first Astronomicall quarter of the yeare, according to my
vsuall account, whatsoever Ptolomie says, beginneth sooner with poore
men than with rich, graunted so by the malignant influence of Saturne,
whose constellation is that suche as haue no money nor credit, shall
want coles &amp; woode, and be faine to stand and starue for colde, while
olde pennifathers sit and wast them selues by the fire. The winter
beginning at that instant when the Sunne makes his entraunce into the
first degree of Capricornus, that Hiemall solstitiall signe shewes that
by naturall inclination this quarter is generally fleugmatike, and that
all shall be of suche great authoritie, that the Bakers Basket shall
giue the wall vnto the Brewers Barrell, and a halfe pennye drie doe
homage vnto a halfe pennye wet. The weather and season being so colde
that diuerse for feare of the frost shall sit all daye at Tables and
Cardes, while their poore wiues and families fast at home for their
follies. And in respect that I finde three of the seauen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> Planetes to
be in waterie signes as Juppiter, Mars, and the Moone, it signifieth
that diuerse persons, both men and women, for want of wine or strong
drinke shall goe to bedde sober against their willes. That Sea-faring
men shall haue ill lucke if / either their shippes hit agaynst rockes
or sticke in the sandes, that there shall bee such great hoarie
frostes, that men and women shall creepe to bedde together, and some of
them lie so long till they bee fetchte out with a Bason. Heere Saturne
retrograde in Gemini, shewes that there shall this Winter fall such
great fogs and mists, that diuerse riche men shall loose their purses
by the high waie side, and poore men be so weather beaten by the crafte
of vsurers, that they shall begge their bread by the extremitie of such
extortion: but Mercurie and Venus beeing congregated in Sagitarie,
prognosticateth that for want of faire weather, such as haue but one
shirt shall go woolward till that be a washing, and that water-men
that want fares shall sit and blowe their fingers till theyr fellowes
row betwixte the Old Swanne and Westminister. And by reason that Mars
that malignant Planet, hath nothing to doe in that Hiemall reuolution,
souldiers this Winter for the most parte, shall lie still in garrisons,
and shall not be troubled with more monie than is necessarie. Beeing
also greatly to bee feared, that through the extreame colde diuerse
poore men shall die at riche mennes doores:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> pittie shall bee exiled,
good woorkes trust ouer the sea with Jacke / a lent and Hospitalitie
banisht as a signe of popish religion: and were it not that some moist
shoures shal moderate the hardnes of the frost, Charitie should for
want of house roome lie and freeze to death in the streets: diuerse
great stormes are this yere to be feared, especially in houses where
the wiues weare the breeches, with such lowde windes, that the women
shall scolde their husbandes quight out of doores, wherevpon is like
to fall great haile-stones as bigge as ioynd stooles, that some shall
haue their heads broken: and all through the froward disposition of
Venus. But Mars comes in and playes the man, who beeing placed in
Gemini, that gouerns armes and shoulders, presageth that sundrie tall
fellowes shall take heart at grasse, who armed with good cudgels, shall
so lambeake these stubborne huswiues, that the wind shall turne into
another quarter, and so the weather waxe more calme and quiet. Such
greate floudes are like to insue, through this Hiemall distemperature,
that diuerse men shall be drowned on drie hilles, and fishe if they
could not swimme, were vtterly like to perish. Eeles are like to bee
deere if there bee few or none taken, and plentie of poutes to bee had
in all places, especiallie in those coastes and Countries where weomen
haue / not their owne willes. Nowe Gentle Reader in respect of diuerse
particular circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> drawne from the daily motions, progressions,
stations, retrogradations, aspects, and other appointmentes of fixed
and wandring stars, I am induced to set downe that such as haue no
fire, shall feele most cold, and that wierdrawers, if they plye not
their worke, shall feele no great heate, that they in Russia shall
suffer more preiudice by the sharpenesse of Winter than the Spaniards:
and yet one thing is to bee hoped for at the handes of Mercurie, that
this winter mony shall haue a fall, for Philip and Mary shillings that
heretofore went for 12d. shall now passe from man to man for 6d. a
peece.</p>

<p>The distemperance of this quarter, is like to breede many sicknesses
and sundrie diseases as well in young as in old, proceeding either
of corrupt and vicious bloud or of superabundance of crude and raw
fleugmatike humors. As Cephala[l]gies or paines in the head, which
shall make men dizzy that some shal stagger &amp; stumble vp &amp; downe the
streetes till they haue stolne a nappe to quiet their braines. Ach in
the shoulders shal raine amongest diuerse women that haue shrewes to
their husbands, and diuerse drunken men shall be pestured with surfets.
Maidens this winter shall haue strange stitches &amp; gripings / of the
collicke, which diseases proceed by too much lying vpright: and men
shall be troubled with such paine in the eies, that they shall not know
their owne wiues from other women, with coughs, rumes, and itchings,
which I omit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><i>Of the Spring time.</i></p>

<p>Winter being finished with the last grade of the watry signe Pisces, at
the Suns ioyful progresse into the first degree of Aries. The second
quarter of our vsuall yere commonly called the spring c&#333;meth next,
which beginneth when grasse begins to sproute, &amp; trees to bud. But to
treat of this present season, forasmuch as I find the planets to be
contradictorily disposed, in signs &amp; mansi&#333;s of diuerse &amp; repugnant
qualities, I gather that this spring will be very il for schollers,
for they shal studie much and gain litle, they shal haue more wit in
their heads then money in their purses, dunces shal proue more welthie
then diuers doctors, insomuch that sundrie vnlettered fooles should
creep into the ministerie, if the prouident care of good Bishops did
not preuent th&#275;. And by the opinion of Proclus, women are like to
grow wilful, &amp; so variable, that they shall laugh &amp; weepe, and all with
a winde: Butchers shal sell / their meate as deare as they can, and
if they be not carefull, horne beastes shall bee hurtfull vnto them,
and some shall bee so wedded to swines flesh, that they shall neuer
be without a sowe in their house as long as they liue. This spring,
or vernall resolution being naturally hot and moist, is like to be
verie forwarde for sprouting fieldes and blooming trees, and because
Saturne is in his proper mansion, olde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> men are like to bee froward,
and craftie knaues shall neede no Brokers, vsurie shalbe called good
husbandrie, and men shalbe counted honest by their wealth, not by their
vertues. And because Aquarius has somthing to do wt this quarter, it
is to be doubted that diuers springs of water will rise vp in vintners
sellers, to the great weakning of their Gascon wine, &amp; the vtter ruine
of the ancient order of the redde noses. March Beere shalbe more
esteemed than small Ale.</p>

<p>Out of the old stocke of heresie, this spring it is to be feared, will
bloome new scismaticall opinions and strange sects, as Brownists,
Barowists, &amp; such balductum deuises, to the great hinderance of the
vnitie of the Church, &amp; confusion of the true faith, if the learned
doctor sir T. Tiburne be not taskte to confute such vpstart companions,
with his plain &amp; dunstable philosophie. Cancer is bu/sie in this
springtide, and therefore it is like that florishing bloomes of yong
gentlemens youth, shalbe greatly anoide with caterpillers, who shall
intangle them in such statutes &amp; recognances, that they shall crie out
against brokers, as Jeremy did against false prophets. Besides, thogh
this last winter nipt vp diuers masterles men &amp; cut purses, yet this
spring is like to afford one euery tearme this ten yere in Westminster
hall: Barbers if they haue no worke are like to grow poore, and for
that Mercury is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> c&#333;bust and many quarelles like to growe amongst
men, lawiers shall proue rich &amp; weare side gowns and large consciences,
hauing theyr mouths open to call for fees, and theyr purses shut when
they shoulde bestowe almes. But take heed O you generation of wicked
Ostlers, that steale haie in the night from gentlemens horses, and rub
their teth with tallow, that they may eate little when they stand at
liuery, this I prognosticate against you, that this spring, which so
euer of you dies, shall leaue a knaues carcasse in the graue behind
him, and that they which liue shall hop a harlot in his clothes all
the yere after. But aboue all let me not hide this secret from my
countrymen, that Jupiter being in aspect with Luna, discouereth that
diuers men shal drinke more th&#275; they bleed, &amp; / Tailers shall steale
nothing but what is brought vnto them, that poulters shall bee pestered
with rotten egs, &amp; Butchers dogs make libels against Lent, that
affoordes no foode but herring cobs for their diet.</p>

<p>Diseases incident to this quarter, as by Astrologicall &amp; philosophicall
coniectures I can gather, are these following: Prentises that haue ben
fore beaten, shall be troubled with ach in their armes, and it shall be
ill for such as haue fore eies, to looke against the Sun. The plague
shall raigne mortally amongst poore men, that diuerse of them shal not
be able to change a man a groate. Olde women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> that haue taken great
colde, may perhaps be trobled with the cough, and such as haue paine in
their teeth, shall bee grieuouslie troubled with the tooth ach. Beside,
sicke folke shall haue worse stomackes then they which be whole, and
men that cannot sleepe, shall take verie little rest: with other
accidentall infirmities, which I doe ouerpasse.</p>


<p class="center"><i>A declaration of the disposition and inclination of the Summer
quarter</i>.</p>

<p>When the Sunne hath made his course through the vernal signs, Aries,
Taurus &amp; Gemini at his passage vnto the solsticiall estiuall signe
Cancer. The third parte of an English yeere called Summer, taketh his
beginning this yere: as Ptolomie sayth, the twelfth of Iune, but as
my skill doth coniecture, it beginneth when the wether waxeth so hot
that beggers scorne barnes and lie in the field for heate, and the
wormes of Saint Pancredge Church build their bowers vnder the shadow of
Colman hedge. The predominant qualities of this quarter is heate and
drynesse, whereby I doe gather, that through the influence of Cancer,
bottle Ale shall be in great authoritie, and wheat shall doe knightes
seruice vnto malte. Tapsters this quarter shall be in greater credite
than Coblers, and many shall drinke more then they can yearne. And yet
because Mercurie is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> a signe that is nowe predominant, women shall
be more troubled with fleas then men, and such as want meate shall
goe supperlesse to bedde. Besides, this quarter great hurlie burlies
are like to bee feared, and greate stratagems like to bee performed,
thorough the opposition of Mars and Saturne: for Butchers are like to
make great hauocke amongest flies, and beggers on Sunne shine dayes to
commit great murthers vpon their rebellious vermine, and the knights of
Coppersmiths hap to / doo great deedes of armes vpon Cuppes, Cannes,
pots, glasses, and black iacks: not ceasing the skirmish til they are
able to stand on their legges.</p>

<p>Further it is to bee doubted, that because Venus is in the house of
Loue, that Millers, Weauers, and Taylors shall be counted as theeuishe
as they are knauishe: and Maides this quarter shall make sillyebubbes
for their Louers, till some of them Calue with the Cowe for companye.
But Iupiter in his exaltation presageth that diuers young Gentlemen
shall creepe further into the Mercers Booke in a Moneth then they can
get out in a yere: and that sundry fellowes in their silkes shall be
appointed to keep Duke Humfrye company in Poules, because they know
not wher to get their dinner abroad: if there be great plenty of
Cherries this Summer, they are like to come to a penny the pound, and
Costard-mongers this Summer shall be licenst by the Wardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> of their
hall, to weare and carry baskets of Apples on their heads to keepe them
from the heat of the Sun. But Libra adust and retrograde, foretelleth
that there is like to be a league between diuers bakers &amp; the pillorye,
for making their bread so light, and the Sun shall be so hotte, that
it shall melt awaye the consciences of diuers couetous men, and that /
by the meanes of Venus which is in the house of Scorpion, women shall
bee so loue sicke, that Sumners and ciuil lawiers shall haue great fees
thorough the aboundance of such sinfull clients, and diuerse spirites
in white sheetes shall stand in Poules and other Churches, to make
their confessions. But this by the waie learne of me, shomakers shall
proue so proud that they shall refuse the name of souters, and the
Tailer and the louse are like to fall at martiall variance, were it not
the worshipfull company of the Botchers haue set downe this order, that
he that lies in his bed while his clothes be mending, neede not haue a
man to keepe his wardroppe. But amongst all, the Smithes haue put vp
a supplication to the Alecunners, that he which goes dronke to bed,
and as soone as hee wakes dares not carouse a hartie draught the next
morning, shall drinke two daies together small Ale for his penance.</p>

<p>This variable season is like to bring variable accidents, for diuerse
diseases which will much molest the people, namely the plurisies which
shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> grieue many, that they shall haue farre more knauerie than they
haue honestie, diuerse fluxes, and especiallie in poore mens purses,
for they shall bee so laxatiue, that money shall runne out faster than
/ they can get it. The small pockes among children and great amongst
men, infirmities in the tong, some shall doe nothing but lie with
others, which I let pas.</p>


<p class="center"><i>A declaration of the inclination and disposition of the Autumnall or
haruest quarter.</i></p>

<p>Haruest and the last quarter of this yeere beginneth, as I coniecture,
when corne is ripe. But for the nature of this autumnall reuolution,
because it beginneth in Libra, I gather there shall be more holes open
this quarter then in all the yeere beside, and strange euents shall
chance, for knaues shall weare smockes, and women shall haue holes in
their heartes, that as fast as loue creepes in at one, it shall runne
out at another. Yet Leo being a firie signe, foresheweth that diuerse
men shall haue their teeth longer then their beards, and some shal be
so Sun burnt with sitting in the Alehouse, that their noses shall bee
able to light a candle. Others shall for want of money paune their
clokes, and march mannerly in theyr doublet and their hose. And some
shall this yere haue barnes and yet want corn to put in them. Rie this
yeere shall bee common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> in / England, and knaues shall be licenst to
sel it by the pound, and he that wil not this quarter spend a pennie
with his friende, by the counsayle of Albumazar, shall bee thrust quite
out of all good companie for his labour.</p>

<p>It may be doubted that some straunge sicknesse and vnknowen diseases
wil happen, as hollownesse of the heart, that a man shall not know a
knaue from an honest man, and vncouth consumptions of the lyuer, that
diuerse men of good wealth shall by their kinde hearts spend all and
die banquerouts: some shal be troubled with diseases in the throate,
which cannot bee helpte without Bull the hang man plaie the skilfull
Chyrurgion. Amongest the rest, many that haue faire wiues shalbe
troubled with greate swelling in the browes, a disease as incurable as
the goute. Some shall bee troubled with the stone, and seeke to cunning
women to cure them of that disease, an infirmitie easilie amended,
and the doctors of Bridewell did not punish such women Phisitians by
a Statute. But the greatest disease that is to bee feared, is the
Cataphalusie, that is to saie, good fellowes this yeere for want of
money shall oft times be contented to part companie.</p>

<p>And / thus (gentle reader) thou hast my prognostication, gathered by
arte, and confirmed by experience, and therefore take it in good worth,
for <i>Quod gratis grate</i>, and so farewell.</p>

thought you inherit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> reuenues of extraordinary wit, will spend
your shallow censure vpon the most elaborate Poeme so lauishly, that
all the painted table-men about you, take you to be heires apparent
to rich <i>Midasse</i>, that had more skill in <i>alchimy</i> then <i>Kelly</i> with
the Phylosophers stone; (for all that he could lay his fingers on,
turned into beaten gold) dry Tobacco with my leaues (you good dry
brained <i>polipragmonists</i>) till your pipe offices smoake with your
pittifully stinking girds shot out against me. I coniure you (as you
come of the right <i>goose-caps</i>) staine not your house; but when at a
new play you take vp the twelue-penny roome next the stage; (because
the Lords and you may seeme to be haile fellow wel-met) there draw
forth this booke, read alowd, laugh alowd, and play the <i>Antickes</i>,
that all the garlike mouthd stinkards may cry out, <i>Away with the
fool</i>. As for thee, Zoylus, goe hang thy selfe: and for thee <i>Momus</i>,
chew nothing but hemlock, and spit nothing but the sirrup of <i>Aloes</i>
vpon my papers, till thy very rotten lungs come forth for anger. I am
Snake-proofe: and, though, with <i>Hanniball</i>, you bring whole hogs-heads
of vinegar-railings, it is impossible for you to quench or come ouer
my <i>Alpine-resolution</i>: I will faile boldly and desperately alongst
the shore of ye Ile of <i>Guls</i>; and in defiance of those terrible
blockhouses, their loggerheads, make a true discouery of their wild
(yet habitable) Country.</p>

<p>Sound an Allarum therefore (O thou my couragious Muse) and, like a
Dutch cryer, make proclamation with thy Drum: the effect of thine
O-<i>yes</i> being, That if any man, woman or child, be he Lord, be he
Lowne, be he Courtier, be he Carter of ye Innes of Court, or Innes of
Citty, that, hating from the bottome of his heart, all good manners
and generous education, is really in loue, or rather doates on that
excellent country lady, <i>Innocent Simplicity</i>, being the first,
fairest, and chiefest Chamber-maide that our great <i>grandame Eue</i>
entertained into seruice: Or if any person aforesaid, longing to make
a voyage in the Ship of Fooles, would venture all the wit that his
mother left him, to liue in the country of <i>Guls</i>, <i>cockneyes</i>, and
<i>coxcombs</i>; to the intent that, ha&#363;ting <i>theaters</i>, he may sit
there, like a popiniay, onely to learne play-speeches, which afterward
may furnish ye necessity of his bare knowledge, to maintaine table
talke, or else, beating <i>tauernes</i>, desires to take the <i>Bacchanalian</i>
degrees, and to write himselfe <i>in arte bibendi magister</i>; that at
ordinaries would sit like Biasse, and in the streets walk like a
braggart, that on foote longs to goe like a French Lacque, and on
horsebacke rides like an English Tailor, or that from seuen yeares
and vpward, till his dying day, has a monethes mind to haue ye <i>Guls
Hornebooke</i> by hearte; by which in time he may be promoted to serue any
Lord in <i>Europe</i>, as his crafty foole, or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> bawdy Jester, yea and
to be so deere to his Lordship, as for the excellency of his fooling,
to be admitted both to ride in Coach with him, and to lie at his very
feete on a truckle-bed. Let all such (and I hope the world has not left
her olde fashions, but there are ten thousand such) repaire hither.
Neuer knocke (you that striue to be Ninny-hammer), but with your feete
spurne open the doore, and enter into our Schoole: you shall not neede
to buy bookes, no, scorne to distinguish a B from a battle doore; onely
looke that your eares be long enough to reach our <i>Rudiments</i>, and you
are made for euer. It is by heart that I would haue you con my lessons,
and therefore be sure to haue most deuouring stomaches. Nor be you
terrified with an opinion, that our <i>rules</i> be hard and indigestible,
or that you shall neuer be good <i>Graduates</i> in these rare sciences of
<i>Barbarisme</i>, and Idiotisme. Oh fie, vppon any man that carries that
vngodly minde! Tush, tush; <i>Tarleton</i>, <i>Kemp</i>, nor <i>Singer</i>, nor all
the litter of Fooles that now come drawling behinde them, neuer played
the clownes more naturally then the arrantest Sot of you all shall if
hee will but boyle my Instructions in his braine-pan.</p>

<p>And lest I my selfe, like some <i>pedantical Vicar</i> stammering out a
most false and crackt latine oration to maister <i>Maior</i> of the towne
and his brethren, should cough and hem in my deliueries; by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
meanes you (my Auditors) should be in danger to depart more like
woodcockes then when you came to me: O thou venerable father of antient
(and therefore hoary) customes, <i>Syluanus</i>, I inuoke thy assistance;
thou that first taughtest Carters to weare hob-nailes, and Lobs to
play Christmas gambols, and to shew the most beastly horse-trickes:
O do thou, or (if thou art not at leasure) let thy Mountibancke,
goat-footed <i>Fauni</i>, inspire me with the knowledge of all those silly
and ridiculous fashions, which the old dunsticall world woare euen
out at elbowes; draw for me the pictures of the most simple fellowes
then liuing, that by their patterns I may paint the like. Awake thou
noblest drunkerd <i>Bacchus</i>, thou must likewise stand to me (if at least
thou canst for reeling), teach me (you soueraigne skinker) how to take
the <i>Germanies vpsy freeze</i>, the Danish <i>Rowsa</i>, the Switzers stoap
of <i>Rhenish</i>, the <i>Italians Parmizant</i>, the Englishmans healthes, his
hoopes, cans, halfecans, Gloues, Frolicks, and flapdragons, together
with the most notorious qualities of the truest tospots, as when to
cast, when to quarrell, when to fight, and where to sleepe: hide not
a drop of thy moist mystery from me (thou plumpest swil-bowle), but
(like an honest red-nosed wine-bibber) lay open all thy secrets, and
ye mystical <i>Hieroglyphick</i> of <i>Rashers</i> a' th' coales, <i>Modicums</i> and
<i>shooing-hornes,</i> and why they were inuented, for what occupations, and
when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> to be vsed. Thirdly (because I will haue more then two strings
to my bow) <i>Comus</i>, thou Clarke of <i>Gluttonies</i> kitchen, doe thou also
bid me proface, and let me not rise from table, till I am perfect in
all the generall rules of <i>Epicures</i> and <i>Cormorants</i>. Fatten thou my
braines, that I may feede others, and teach them both how to squat
downe to their meat, and how to munch so like Loobies, that the wisest
<i>Solon</i> in the world, shall not be able to take them for any other. If
there be any strength in thee, thou beggerly Monarche of <i>Indians</i>,
and setter-vp of rotten-lungd chimneysweepers (<i>Tobacco</i>), I beg it at
thy smoaky hands: make me thine adopted heire, that, inheriting the
vertues of thy whiffes, I may / distribute them amongst all nations,
and make the phantastick <i>Englishmen</i> (aboue the rest) more cunning
in the distinction of thy <i>Rowle Trinidado</i>, <i>Leafe</i>, and <i>Pudding</i>,
then the whitest toothd Blackamoore in all <i>Asia</i>. After thy pipe, shal
ten thousands be taught to daunce, if thou wilt but discouer to me the
sweetnesse of thy snuffes, with the manner of spawling, slauering,
spetting and driueling in all places, and before all persons. Oh what
songs will I charme out, in praise of those valiantly-strong-stinking
breaths, which are easily purchased at thy hands, if I can but get thee
to trauell through my nose. All the foh's in the fairest Ladies mouth,
that euer kist Lord, shall not fright me from thy browne pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>ence: for
thou art humble, and from the Courts of Princes hast vouchsafed to be
acquainted with penny galleries, and (like a good-fellow) to be drunke
for company, with Water-men, Carmen, and Colliers; whereas before,
and so still, Knights and wise Gentlemen were, &amp; are thy companions.
Last of all, thou Lady of Clownes and Carters, Schoolmistres of fooles
and wiseacres, thou homely (but harmelesse) <i>Rusticity</i>, Oh breath
thy dull and dunsticall spirit into our ganders quill; crowne me thy
Poet, not with a garland of Bayes (Oh no! the number of those that
steale <i>lawret</i> is too monstrous already) but swaddle thou my browes
with those unhansome boughes, which, (like <i>Autums</i> rotten haire),
hang dangling ouer thy dusty eye-lids. Helpe me (thou midwife of
vnmannerlinesse) to be deliuered of this <i>Embryon</i> that lies tumbling
in my braine: direct me in this hard and dangerous voyage, that being
safely arriued on the desired shore, I may build up Altars to thy
<i>Vnmatcheable Rudeness</i>; the excellency whereof I know will be so
great, that <i>Grout-nowles</i> and <i>Moames</i> will in swarmes fly buzzing
about thee. So <i>Herculean</i> a labour is this, that I vndertake, that
I am enforced to ball out for all your succours, to the intent I may
aptly furnish this feast of <i>Fooles</i>, vnto which I solemnely inuite all
the world; for at it shall sit not only those whom <i>Fortune</i> fauours,
but euen those whose wits are naturally their owne. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> because your
artificiall fooles beare away the bell, all our best workmanship (at
this time) shall be spent to fashion such a Creature.</p>

<p class="center">The old world, &amp; the new weighed together: the Tailors of those times,
and these compared: the apparell, and dyet of our first fathers.</p>


<p>Good cloathes are the embrodred trappings of pride, and good cheere
the very <i>eringo-roote</i> of gluttony: so that fine backes, and fat
bellyes are Coach-horses to two of the seuen deadly sins: In the bootes
of which Coach, <i>Lechery</i> and <i>Sloth</i> sit like the waiting-maide. In
a most desperate state therefore doe Taylors, and Cookes stand, by
meanes of their offices: for both those trades are Apple-squires to
that couple of sinnes. The one inuents more phantasticke fashions,
then Fraunce hath worne since her first stone was laid; the other more
lickerish <i>epycurean</i> dishes, then were euer serud vp to <i>Gallonius</i>
table. Did man (thinke you) come wrangling into the world, about no
better matters, then all his lifetime to make priuy searches in Burchin
lane for Whalebone doublets, or for pies of <i>Nightingale</i> tongues in
<i>Heliogabalus</i> his kitchin? No, no, the first suit of apparell, that
euer mortall man put on, came neither from the Mercers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> shop nor the
Merchants warehouse: <i>Adams</i> bill would haue beene taken then, sooner
then a Knights bond now; yet was hee great in no bodies bookes for
satten and veluets: the silkwormes had something else to do in those
dayes, then to set vp loomes, and be free of the weauers: his breeches
were not so much worth as K. <i>Stephens</i>, that cost but a poore noble:
for <i>Adams</i> holyday hose and doublet were of no better stuffe then
plaine fig-leaues, and <i>Eues</i> best gowne of the same peece: there went
but a paire of sheeres betweene them. An <i>Antiquary</i> in this towne,
has yet some of the powder of those leaues dryed to shew. Taylors then
were none of the twelue Companies: their Hall, that now is larger
then some Dorpes among the <i>Netherlands</i>, was then no bigger then a
Dutch Butchers shop: they durst not strike downe their customers with
large billes: <i>Adam</i> cared not an apple-paring for all their lousy
hems. There was then neither the <i>Spanish</i> slop, nor the Skippers
galligaskin: the <i>Switzers</i> blistred Cod-piece, nor the <i>Danish</i> sleeue
sagging / down like a Welch wallet, the <i>Italians</i> close strosser, nor
the French standing coller: your trebble-quadruple <i>Dædalian</i> ruffes,
nor your stiffenecked <i>rebatoes</i> (that haue more arches for pride to
row vnder, then can stand vnder fiue London Bridges) durst not then set
themselues out in print: for the patent for starch could by no meanes
be signd. Fashions then was counted a disease, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> horses dyed of it:
But now (thankes to folly) it is held the onely rare phisicke, and the
purest golden Asses liue vpon it.</p>

<p>As for the dyet of that <i>Saturnian</i> age, it was like their attire,
homely: A sallad, and a messe of leeke porridge, was a dinner for a
farre greater man then euer the <i>Turke</i> was: Potato-pies, and Custards,
stood like the sinfull suburbs of Cookery, and had not a wall (so much
as a handfull hie) built rownd about them. There were no daggers then,
nor no Chayres. <i>Crookes</i> his ordinary, in those parsimonious dayes,
had not a Capons-leg to throw at a dog. Oh golden world, the suspicious
<i>Venecian</i> carued not his meate with a siluer pitch-forke, neither did
the sweet-toothd Englishman shift a dozen of trenchers at one meale.
Peirs ploughman layd the cloth, and Simplicity brought in the voyder.
How wonderfully is the world altered? and no maruell, for it has lyein
sicke almost fiue thousand yeares: So that it is no more like the old
<i>Theater du munde</i>, than old <i>Paris</i> garden is like the Kings garden at
<i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>What an excellent workeman therefore were he that could cast the Globe
of it into a new mould: And not to make it look like <i>Mullineux</i>
his Globe, with a round face sleekt and washt ouer with whites of
egges; but to haue it <i>in Plano</i>, as it was at first, with all the
ancient circles, lines, paralels, and figures, representing indeede,
all the wrinckles, crackes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> creuises and flawes that (like the Mole
on <i>Hattens</i> cheek, being <i>os amoris</i>,) stuck vpon it at the first
creation, and made it looke most louely; but now those furrowes are
filled vp with Ceruse, and Vermilion; yet all will not doe, it appeares
more vgly. Come, come, it would be but a bald world, but that it weares
a periwig. The body of it is fowle (like a birding-peece) by being too
much heated: the breath of it stinks like the mouthes of Chambermaides
by feeding on so many sweat meats. And, though to purge it wil be a
sorer labour then the clensing / of <i>Augeaes</i> stable, or the scowring
of Mooreditch: yet, <i>Ille ego, qui quondam</i>; I am the <i>Pasquille
madcap</i>, that will doot.</p>

<p>Draw neere therefore, all you that loue to walke vpon single and simple
soules, and that wish to keepe company with none but Innocents, and&#922;&#945;&#961;&#951;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#8001;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#962;
the sonnes of ciuill Citizens, out with your tables, and naile your
eares (as it were to the pillary) to the <i>musique</i> of our instructions:
nor let ye title <i>Gullery</i>, fright you fr&#333; schoole: for marke
what an excellent ladder you are to clime by. How many worthy, and
men of famous memory (for their learning of all offices, from the
scauenger and so vpward) haue flourished in London of ye ancient
familie of ye <i>Wiseacres</i>, being now no better esteemd then fooles
and yonger brothers? This geare must be lookt into, lest in time (O
lamentable time, when that houre-glasse is turned vp) a rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> mans
sonne shall no sooner peepe out of the shell of his minority but he
shall straightwaies be begd for a concealement, or set vpon (as it
were, by free-booters) and tane in his owne purse-nets by fencers and
cony-catchers. To driue which pestilent infection from the heart,
heeres a medicine more potent, and more precious, than was euer that
mingle-mangle of drugs which <i>Mithrydates</i> boyld together. Feare not to
tast it: a cawdle will not goe downe halfe so smoothly as this will:
you neede not call the honest name of it in question, for Antiquity
puts off his cap, and makes a bare oration in praise of the vertues of
it: the <i>Receipt</i> hath beene subscribed vnto, by all those that haue
had to doe with <i>Simples</i>, with this moth-eaten <i>Motto, Probatum est</i>:
your <i>Diacatholicon aureum</i>, that with gun-powder brings threaten[ing]s
to blow vp all diseases that come in his way, and smels worse then
<i>Assafætida</i> in respect of this. You therefore whose bodyes, either
ouerflowing with the corrupt humours of this ages phantasticknesse, or
else being burnt vp with the infl&#257;mation of vpstart fashions, would
faine be purgd: and to shew that you truly loath this polluted and
mangy-fisted world, turne Timonists, not caring either for men or their
maners. Doe you pledge me, spare not to take a deepe draught of our
homely councel. The cup is full, and so large, that I boldly drinke a
health vnto all commers. /</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How a young Gallant shall not onely keepe his clothes (which many of
them can hardly doe for Brokers) but also saue the charges of taking
physicke; with other rules for the morning, the praise of Sleepe, and
of going naked.</p></blockquote>


<p>You haue heard all this while nothing but the <i>Prologue</i>, and seene no
more but a dumbe shew: Our <i>vetus Comædia</i> steps out now. The fittest
stage vpon which you (that study to be an Actor there) are first to
present your selfe is (in my approued judgement) the softest and
largest Downe-bed: from whence (if you will but take sound councell
of your pillow) you shall neuer rise, till you heare it ring noone at
least. Sleep, in the name of <i>Morpheus</i>, your bellyfull, or (rather)
sleepe till you heare your belly grombles and waxeth empty. Care
not for those coorse painted cloath rimes, made by ye Uniuersity of
<i>Salerne</i>, that come ouer you, with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sit breuis, aut nullus, tibi somnus meridianus.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Short let thy sleepe at noone be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather let it none be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sweete candied councell, but theres rats-bane vnder it: trust neuer a
Bachiler of Art of them all, for he speakes your health faire, but to
steale away the maidenhead of it: <i>Salerne</i> stands in the luxurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
country of <i>Naples</i>, and who knowes not that the <i>Neapolitan</i>, will
(like <i>Derick</i> the hangman) embrace you with one arme, and rip your
guts with the other? theres not a haire in his mustachoo, but if he
kisse you, will stabbe you through the cheekes like a ponyard: the
slaue, to be auenged on his enemy, will drink off a pint of poison
himselfe so that he may be sure to haue the other pledge him but
halfe so much. And it may be, that vpon some secret grudge to worke
the generall destruction of all mankinde, those verses were composed.
<i>Phisisians</i>, I know (and none else) tooke vp the bucklers in their
defence, railing bitterly vpon that venerable and princely custom of
<i>long-lying-abed</i>: Yet, now I remember me, I cannot blame them; for /
they which want sleepe (which is mans naturall rest) become either mere
<i>Naturals</i>, or else fall into the Doctors hands, and so consequently
into the Lords: whereas he that snorts profoundly scornes to let
<i>Hippocrates</i> himselfe stand tooting on his Urinall, and thereby saues
that charges of a groates worth of Physicke: And happy is that man that
saues it; for phisick is <i>Non minus venefica, quam benefica</i>, it hath
an ounce of gall in it, for euery dram of hony. Ten <i>Tyburnes</i> cannot
turne men ouer ye perch so fast as one of these brewers of purgations:
the very nerues of their practise being nothing but <i>Ars Homicidiorum</i>,
an Art to make poore soules kicke vp their heeles. In so much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> that
euen their sicke grunting patients stand in more danger of M. Doctor
and his drugs, then of all the Cannon shots which the desperate disease
it selfe can discharge against them. Send them packing therefore, to
walke like <i>Italian Mountebankes</i>, beate not your braines to vnderstand
their parcell-greeke, parcell-latine gibrish: let not all their
sophisticall buzzing into your eares, nor their <i>Satyricall</i> canuassing
of feather-beds and tossing men out of their warme blanckets, awake you
till the houre that heere is prescribed.</p>

<p>For doe but consider what an excellent thing sleepe is: It is so
inestimable a Jewel, that, if a Tyrant would giue his crowne for an
houres slumber, it cannot be bought: of so beautifull a shape is it,
that though a man lye with an Empresse, his heart cannot be at quiet,
till he leaues her embracements to be at rest with the other: yea, so
greatly indebted are we to this kinseman of death, that we owe the
better tributary, halfe of our life to him: and thers good cause why we
should do so: for sleepe is that golden chaine that ties health and our
bodies together. Who complains of want? of woundes? of cares? of great
mens oppressions, of captiuity? whilest he sleepeth? Beggers in their
beds take as much pleasure as Kings: can we therefore surfet on this
delicate <i>Ambrosia</i>? can we drink too much of that whereof to tast too
little tumbles vs into a church-yard, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> vse it but indifferently,
throwes vs into Bedlam? No, no, looke vppon <i>Endymion</i>, the Moones
Minion, who slept threescore and fifteene yeares, and was not a haire
the worse for it. Can lying abedde till noone then (being not the
threescore and fifteenth thousand part of his nap) be hurtfull?</p>

<p>Besides, by the opinion of all Phylosophers and Physitians, it is
not good to trust the aire with our bodies / till the Sun with his
flame-coloured wings, hath fand away the mistie smoake of the morning,
and refind that thicke tobacco-breath which the rheumaticke night
throwes abroad of purpose to put out the eye of the Element: which
worke questionlesse cannot be perfectly finished, till the sunnes
Car-horses stand prancing on the very top of highest noon: so that then
(and not till then) is the most healthfull houre to be stirring. Do
you require examples to perswade you? At what time do Lords and Ladies
vse to rise, but then? your simpring Merchants wiues are the fairest
lyers in the world: and is not eleuen a clocke their common houre?
they finde (no doubt) vnspeakable sweetnesse in such lying, else they
would not day by day put it so in practise. In a word, midday slumbers
are golden; they make the body fat, the skin faire, the flesh plump,
delicate and tender; they set a russet colour on the cheekes of young
women, and make lusty courage to rise vp in men; they make vs thrifty,
both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> in sparing victuals (for breakefasts thereby are savd from the
hell-mouth of the belly) and in preseruing apparell; for while wee warm
us in our beds, our clothes are not worne.</p>

<p>The casements of thine eyes being then at this commendable time of the
day, newly set open, choose rather to haue thy wind-pipe cut in peeces
then to salute any man. Bid not good-morrow so much as to thy father,
tho he be an Emperour. An idle ceremony it is, and can doe him little
good; to thy selfe it may bring much harme: for if he be a wise man
that knowes how to hold his peace, of necessity must he be counted a
foole that cannot keep his tongue.</p>

<p>Amongst all the wild men that runne vp and downe in this wide forest
of fooles (the world) none are more superstitious then those notable
<i>Ebritians</i>, the Jewes: yet a Jewe neuer weares his cap threed-bare
with putting it off: neuer bends i' th' hammes with casting away a
leg: neuer cries <i>God saue you</i>, tho he sees the Diuell at your elbow.
Play the Jewes therefore in this, and saue thy lips that labour, onely
remember, that so soone as thy eyelids be vnglewd, thy first exercise
must be (either sitting vpright on thy pillow, or rarely loling at thy
bodies whole length) to yawne, to stretch,&mdash;and to gape wider then
any oyster-wife: for thereby thou doest not onely send out the liuely
spirits (like vaunt-currers) to fortifie and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> good the vttermost
borders of the body; but also (as a cunning painter) thy goodly
lineaments are drawne out in their fairest proportion.</p>

<p>This lesson being playd, turne ouer a new leafe, and (vnlesse that
Freezeland Curre, cold winter, offer to bite thee) walke awhile vp and
downe thy chamber, either in thy thin shirt onely, or else (which, at
a bare word, is both more decent and more delectable) strip thy selfe
stark naked. Are we not borne so? and shall a foolish custome make vs
to breake the lawes of our Creation? our first parents, so long as they
went naked, were suffered to dwell in paradice, but, after they got
coates to their backes, they were turnd out of doores. Put on therefore
either no apparel at all, or put it on carelessly: for looke how much
more delicate libertie is then bondage, so much is the loosenesse
in wearing of our attire aboue the imprisonment of being neatly and
Tailor-like drest vp in it. To be ready in our clothes, is to be ready
for nothing else. A man lookes as if hee be hung in chaines; or like
a scarcrow: and as those excellent birds (whom <i>Pliny</i> could neuer
haue the wit to catch in all his sprindges) commonly called woodcocks
(whereof there is great store in England) hauing all their feathers
pluckt from their backes, and being turnd out as naked as <i>Platoes</i>
cocke was before all <i>Diogenes</i> his Schollers: or as the Cuckooe in
Christmas, are more fit to come to any Knights board, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> are indeede
more seruiceable then when they are lapt in their warme liueries: euen
so stands the case with man. Truth (because the bald-pate her father
<i>Time</i> has no haire to couer his head) goes (when she goes best) starke
naked; But falshood has euer a cloake for the raine. You see likewise,
that the Lyon, being the king of beasts, the horse, being the lustiest
creature, the Vnicorne, whose horne is worth halfe a City; all these go
with no more clothes on their backes, then what nature hath bestowed
vpon them: But your babiownes, and you[r] Jackanapes (being the scum
and rascality of all the hedge-creepers) they go in ierkins and
mandilions: marry how? They are put into their rags onely in mockery.</p>

<p>Oh beware therefore both what you weare, and how you weare / it, and
let this heauenly reason moue you neuer to be hansome, for, when the
sunne is arising out of his bed, does not the element seeme more
glorious, then (being onely in gray) then at noone, when hees in all
his brauery? it were madnesse to deny it. What man would not gladly see
a beautifull woman naked, or at least with nothing but a lawne, or some
loose thing ouer her; and euen highly lift her vp for being so? Shall
wee then abhorre that in our selues which we admire and hold to be so
excellent in others?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Absit.</i></p>

<p class="center">How a yong Gallant should warme himself by the fire; how attire
himself: The description of a mans head: the praise of long haire.</p>

<p>But if (as it often happens vnlesse the yeare catch the sweating
sicknesse) the morning, like charity waxing cold, thrust his frosty
fingers into thy bosome, pinching thee black and blew (with her nailes
made of yce) like an inuisible goblin, so that thy teeth (as if thou
wert singing prick-song) stand coldly quauering in thy head, and leap
vp and downe like the nimble Iackes of a paire of Virginals: be then as
swift as a whirle-winde, and as boystrous in tossing all thy cloathes
in a rude heape together: With which bundle filling thine armes, steppe
brauely forth, crying: <i>Room, what a coyle keepe you about the fire?</i>
The more are set round about it, the more is thy commendation, if thou
either bluntly ridest ouer their shoulders, or tumblest aside their
stooles to creepe into the chimney-corner: there toast thy body, till
thy scorched skinne be speckled all ouer, being staind with more motley
colours then are to be scene on the right side of the rainebow.</p>

<p>Neither shall it be fit for the state of thy health, to put on thy
Apparell, till by sitting in that hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>house of the chimney, thou
feelest the fat dew of thy body (like basting) run trickling down thy
sides: for by that meanes thou maist lawfully boast that thou liuest by
the sweat of thy browes.</p>

<p>As / for thy stockings and shoos, so weare them, that all men may
point at thee, and make thee famous by that glorious name of a
<i>Male-content</i>. Or, if thy quicksiluer can runne so farre on thy
errant, as to fetch thee bootes out of S. Martens, let it be thy
prudence to haue the tops of them wide as ye mouth of a wallet, and
those with fringed boote-hose ouer them to hang downe to thy ankles.
Doues are accounted innocent, and louing creatures: thou, in obseruing
this fashion, shalt seeme to be a rough-footed doue, and be held as
innocent. Besides, the strawling, which of necessity so much lether
between thy legs must put thee into, will be thought not to grow from
thy disease, but from that gentleman-like habit.</p>

<p>Hauing thus apparelled thee from top to toe, according to that simple
fashion, which the best <i>Goose-caps</i> in <i>Europe</i> striue to imitate, it
is now high time for me to haue a blow at thy head, which I will not
cut off with sharp documents, but rather set it on faster, bestowing
vpon it such excellent caruing, that, if all the wise men of <i>Gottam</i>
should lay their heades together, their Jobbernowles should not bee
able to compare with thine.</p>

<p>To maintaine therefore that sconce of thine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> strongly guarded, and
in good reparation, neuer suffer combe to fasten his teeth there: let
thy haire grow thick and bushy like a forrest, or some wildernesse;
lest those sixe-footed creatures that breede in it, and are Tenants to
that crowne-land of thine, bee hunted to death by euery base barbarous
<i>Barber</i>; and so that delicate, and tickling pleasure of scratching, be
vtterly taken from thee: For the <i>Head</i> is a house built for <i>Reason</i>
to dwell in; and thus is the tenement framed. The two Eyes are the
glasse windowes, at which light disperses itself into euery roome,
hauing goodly penthouses of haire to ouershadow them: As for the
nose, tho some (most iniuriously and improperly) make it serue for an
<i>Indian</i> chimney, yet surely it is rightly a bridge with two arches,
vnder which are neat passages to conuey as well perfumes to aire and
sweeten euery chamber, as to carry away all noisome filth that is swept
out of vncleane corners: the cherry lippes open, like the new-painted
gates of a Lord Mayor's house, to take in prouision. The tongue is a
bell, hanging iust vnder the middle of the roofe; and / lest it should
be rung out too deepe (as sometimes it is when women haue a peale)
whereas it was cast by the first founder, but onely to tole softly,
there are two euen rowes of Iuory pegs (like pales) set to keep it
in. The eares are two Musique roomes, into which as well good sounds
as bad, descend downe two narrow paire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> staires, that for all the
world haue crooked windings like those that lead to the top of Powles
steeple; and, because when the tunes are once gotten in, they should
not too quickly slip out, all the walles of both places are plaistered
with yellow wax round about them. Now, as the fairest lodging, tho it
be furnisht with walles, chimnies, chambers, and all other parts of
Architecture, yet, if the seeleing be wanting, it stands subiect to
raine, and so consequently to ruine. So would this goodly palace, which
wee haue moddeld out vnto you, be but a cold and bald habitation, were
not the top of it rarely couered. Nature therfore has plaid the Tyler,
and giuen it a most curious couering, or (to speake more properly) she
has thatcht it all ouer, and that <i>Thatching</i> is haire. If then thou
desirest to reserue that Fee-simple of wit (thy head) for thee and
the lawfull heires of thy body, play neither the scuruy part of the
Frenchman, that pluckes vp all by ye rootes, nor that of the spending
Englishman, who, to maintaine a paltry warren of vnprofitable Conies,
disimparkes the stately swift-footed wild Deere: But let thine receiue
his full growth, that thou maiest safely and wisely brag 'tis thine
owne <i>Bush-Naturall</i>.</p>

<p>And with all consider that, as those trees of cobweblawne (wouen by
Spinners the fresh May-mornings) doe dresse the curled heads of the
mountaines, and adorne the swelling bosomes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> valleyes: Or, as
those snowy fleeces, which the naked bryer steales from the innocent
nibbling sheep, to make himselfe a warm winter liuery, are to either
of them both an excellent ornament: So make thou account, that to haue
fethers sticking heere and there on thy head, will embellish, and set
thy crowne out rarely. None dare vpbraid thee, that like a begger thou
hast lyen on straw, or like a trauelling Pedler vpon musty flockes: for
those feathers will rise vp as witnesses to choake him that sayes so,
and to proue that thy bed was of the softest downe.</p>

<p>When / your noblest Gallants consecrate their houres to their
Mistresses and to Reuelling, they weare fethers then chiefly in their
hattes, being one of the fairest ensignes of their brauery: But thou,
a Reueller and a Mistris-seruer all the yeare, by wearing fethers in
thy haire, whose length before the rigorous edge of any puritanicall
paire of scizzers should shorten the breadth of a finger, let the three
huswifely spinsters of Destiny rather curtall the thread of thy life. O
no, long hair is the onely nette that women spread abroad to entrappe
men in; and why should not men be as far aboue women in that commodity,
as they go beyond men in others? The merry <i>Greekes</i> were called
&#922;&#945;&#961;&#951;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#8001;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#962; long-haired: loose not thou (being an honest
<i>Troian</i>) that honour, sithence it will more fairely become thee.
Grasse is the haire of the earth, which, so long as it is suffred to
grow, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> becomes the wearer, and carries a most pleasing colour, but
when the Sunne-burnt clowne makes his mowes at it, and (like a Barber)
shaues it off to the stumps, then it withers and is good for nothing
but to be trust vp and thrown amongst Jades. How vgly is a bald pate?
it lookes like a face wanting a nose; or, like ground eaten bare with
the arrowes of Archers, whereas a head al hid in haire giues euen to
a most wicked face a sweet proportion, and lookes like a meddow newly
marryed to the <i>Spring</i>: which beauty in men the Turkes enuying, they
no sooner lay hold on a Christian, but the first marke they set vpon
him, to make him know hees a slaue, is to shaue off all his haire close
to the scull. A <i>Mahumetan</i> cruelty therefore is it, to stuffe breeches
and tennis-balles with that, which, when tis once lost, all the
hare-hunters in the world may sweat their hearts out, and yet hardly
catch it againe.</p>

<p>You then, to whom chastity has giuen an heire apparant, take order that
it may be apparant, and to that purpose, let it play openly with the
lascivious wind, eu&#275; on the top of your shoulders. Experience cries
out in euery Citty, that those self-same Criticall <i>Saturnists</i>, whose
haire is shorter than their eye-brows, take a pride to haue their hoary
beards hang slauering like a dozen of Foxetailes downe so low as their
middle. But (alas) why should the chinnes and lippes of old men lick vp
that excrement, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> vyolently clip away from the heads of yong
men? Is it / because those long beesomes (their beards) with sweeping
the soft bosomes of their beautiful yong wiues, may tickle their
tender breasts, and make some amends for their maisters' vnrecoverable
dulnesse? No, no, there hangs more at the ends of those long gray
haires then all the world can come to the knowledge of. Certaine I
am, that when none but the golden age went currant vpon earth, it was
higher treason to clip haire, then to clip money: the combe and scizers
were condemned to the currying of hackneyes: he was disfranchised for
euer, that did but put on a Barbers apron. Man, woman, and child woare
then haire longer then a law-suit; euery head, when it stood bare or
uncouered, lookt like a butter-boxes nowle, hauing his thrumbd cap on.
It was free for all Nations to haue shaggy pates, as it is now onely
for the Irishman. But since this polling and shauing world crept vp,
locks were lockt up, and haire fell to decay. Reuiue thou therefore the
old, buryed fashion, and (in scorne of periwigs and sheep-shearing)
keep thou that quilted head-peece on continually. Long haire will make
thee looke dreadfully to thine enemies, and manly to thy friends. It
is, in peace, an ornament; in warre, a strong helmet. It blunts the
edge of a sword, and deads the leaden thump of a bullet. In winter, it
is a warme night-cap, in sommer, a cooling fanne of fethers.</p>

<p class="center">How a Gallant should behaue himselfe in Powles walkes.</p>


<p>Being weary with sayling vp and downe alongst these shores of
<i>Barbaria</i>, heere let vs cast our anchors, and nimbly leape to land in
our coasts, whose fresh aire shall be so much the more pleasing to vs,
if the <i>Ninny hammer</i> (whose perfection we labour to set forth) haue
so much foolish wit left him as to choose the place where to sucke in:
for that true humorous Gallant that desires to powre himselfe into all
fashions (if his ambition be such to excell euen Complement itselfe)
must as well practise to diminish his walkes, as to bee various in
his sallets, curious in his Tobacco, or ingenious in the trussing vp
of a new Scotch-hose: / All which vertues are excellent and able to
maintaine him, especially if the old worme-eaten Farmer (his father)
bee dead, and left him fiue hundred a yeare, onely to keepe an Irish
hobby, an Irish horse-boy, and himselfe (like a gentleman). Hee
therefore that would striue to fashion his leggs to his silke stockins,
and his proud gate to his broad garters, let him whiffe downe these
obseruations; for, if he once get to walke by the booke (and I see no
reason but he may, as well as fight by the booke) Powles may be proud
of him, <i>Will Clarke</i> shall ring forth <i>Encomiums</i> in his honour, Iohn
in Powles <i>Church-yard</i>, shall fit his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> head for an excellent blocke,
whilest all the Innes of Court reioyce to behold his most hansome calfe.</p>

<p>Your Mediterranean Ile, is then the onely gallery, wherein the pictures
of all your true fashionate and complementall <i>Guls</i> are, and ought to
be hung vp: into that gallery carry your neat body, but take heede you
pick out such an hour when the maine Shoale of Ilanders are swimming
vp and downe. And first obserue your doores of entrance, and your
<i>Exit</i>, not much vnlike the plaiers at the Theaters, keeping your
<i>Decorums</i>, euen in phantasticality. As for example: if you proue to be
a <i>Northerne</i> Gentleman, I would wish you to passe through the North
doore, more often (especially) then any of the other: and so, according
to your countries, take note of your entrances.</p>

<p>Now for your venturing into the Walke, be circumspect and wary what
piller you come in at, and take heede in any case (as you loue the
reputation of your honour) that you auoide the <i>Seruing-mans</i> logg,
and approch not within fiue fadom of that Piller; but bend your course
directly in the middle line, that the whole body of the Church may
appeare to be yours; where, in view of all, you may publish your suit
in what manner you affect most, either with the slide of your cloake
from the one shoulder, and then you must (as twere in anger) suddenly
snatch at the middle of the inside (if it be taffata at the least) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
so by that meanes your costly lining is betrayd, or else by the pretty
aduantage of Complement. But one note by the way do I especially wooe
you to, the neglect of which makes many of our Gallants cheape and
ordinary, that by no meanes you be seene aboue foure turnes; but in the
fift make your selfe away, either in some of the / Sempsters' shops,
the new Tobacco-office, or amongst the Booke-sellers, where, if you
cannot reade, exercise your smoake, and inquire who has writ against
this diuine weede, &amp;c. For this withdrawing your selfe a little, will
much benefite your suit, which else, by too long walking, would be
stale to the whole spectators: but howsoeuer if Powles Jacks bee once
vp with their elbowes, and quarrelling to strike eleuen, as soone as
euer the clock has parted them, and ended the fray with his hammer, let
not the Dukes gallery conteyne you any longer, but passe away apace in
open view. In which departure, if by chance you either encounter, or
aloofe off throw your inquisitiue eye vpon any knight or Squire, being
your familiar, salute him not by his name of Sir such a one, or so,
but call him <i>Ned</i>, or <i>Jack</i>, &amp;c. This will set off your estimation
with great men: and if (tho there be a dozen companies betweene you,
tis the better) hee call aloud to you (for thats most gentile), to
know where he shall find you at two a clock, tell him at such an
Ordinary, or such, and bee sure to name those that are deerest:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> and
whither none but your Gallants resort. After dinner you may appeare
againe, hauing translated yourselfe out of your English cloth cloak,
into a light Turky-grogram (if you haue that happinesse of shifting)
and then be seene (for a turne or two) to correct your teeth with some
quill or siluer instrument, and to cleanse your gummes with a wrought
handkercher: It skilles not whether you dinde or no (thats best knowne
to your stomach) or in what place you dinde, though it were with cheese
(of your owne mother's making) in your chamber or study.</p>

<p>Now if you chance to be a Gallant not much crost among Citizens,
that is, a Gallant in the Mercers bookes, exalted for Sattens and
veluets, if you be not so much blest to bee crost as I hold it the
greatest blessing in the world, to bee great in no mans bookes) your
Powles walke is your onely refuge: the Dukes Tomb is a Sanctuary,
and will keepe you aliue from wormes and land-rattes, that long to
be feeding on your carkas: there you may spend your legs in winter
a whole after-noone: conuerse, plot, laugh, and talke any thing,
iest at your Creditor, euen to his face, and in the euening, euen
by lamp-light, steale out, and so cozen a whole couy of abhominable
catch-pols. Neuer / be seene to mount the steppes into the quire, but
vpon a high Festiuall day, to preferre the fashion of your doublet, and
especially if the singing-boyes seeme to take note of you: for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> they
are able to buzze your praises aboue their <i>Anthems</i>, if their voyces
haue not lost their maiden-heads: but be sure your siluer spurres dog
your heeles, and then the Boyes will swarme about you like so many
white butter-flyes, when you in the open Quire shall drawe forth a
perfumed embrodred purse (the glorious sight of which will entice many
Countrymen from their deuotion to wondering) and quoyt siluer into the
Boyes handes, that it may be heard aboue the first lesson, although it
be reade in a voyce as big as one of the great Organs.</p>

<p>This noble and notable Act being performed, you are to vanish presently
out of the Quire, and to appeare againe in the walk: But in any wise be
not obserued to tread there long alone: for feare you be suspected to
be a Gallant casheerd from the society of <i>Captens</i> and <i>Fighters</i>.</p>

<p>Sucke this humour vp especially. Put off to none, vnlesse his hatband
be of a newer fashion then yours, and three degrees quainter: but for
him that weares a trebled cipers about his hatte (though he were an
Aldermans sonne) neuer moue to him: for hees suspected to be worse then
a <i>Gull</i>, and not worth the putting off to, that cannot obserue the
time of his hatband, nor know what fashioned block is most kin to his
head: for, in my opinion, ye braine that cannot choose his Felt well
(being the head ornament) must needes powre folly into all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> rest of
the members, and be an absolute confirmed Foole in <i>Summâ Totali</i>.</p>

<p>All the diseased horses in a tedious siege cannot shew so many
fashions, as are to be seene for nothing, euery day, in Duke <i>Humfryes
walke</i>. If therefore you determine to enter into a new suit, warne your
Tailor to attend you in Powles, who, with his hat in his hand, shall
like a spy discouer the stuffe, colour, and fashion of any doublet, or
hose that dare be seene there, and stepping behind a piller to fill his
table-bookes with those notes, will presently send you into the world
an accomplisht man: by which meanes you shall weare your clothes in
print with the first edition. But / if Fortune fauour you so much as
to make you no more then a meere country gentleman, or but some three
degrees remoud from him (for which I should be very sorie, because
your London-experience wil cost you deere before you shall haue ye wit
to know what you are) then take this lesson along with you: The first
time that you venture into Powles, passe through the body of the Church
like a Porter, yet presume not to fetch so much as one whole turne in
the middle Ile, no nor to cast an eye to <i>Si quis</i> doore (pasted and
plaistered vp with Seruing-mens <i>supplications</i>) before you haue paid
tribute to the top of Powles <i>steeple</i> with a single penny: And when
you are mounted there, take heede how you looke downe into the yard;
for the railes are as rotten as your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> great-Grandfather; and thereupon
it will not be amisse if you enquire how <i>Kit Woodroffe</i> durst vault
ouer, and what reason he had for it, to put his necke in hazard of
reparations. From hence you may descend, to talke about the horse that
went vp, and striue, if you can, to know his keeper: take the day of
the Moneth, and the number of the steppes, and suffer yourselfe to
belieue verily that it was not a horse, but something else in the
likenesse of one: which wonders you may publish, when you returne into
the country, to the great amazement of all Farmers Daughters, that will
almost swound at the report, and neuer recouer till their banes bee
asked twice in the Church.</p>

<p>But I haue not left you yet. Before you come downe againe, I would
desire you to draw your knife, and graue your name (or, for want of a
name, the marke, which you clap on your sheep) in great Characters vpon
the leades, by a number of your brethren (both Citizens and country
Gentlemen), and so you shall be sure to haue your name lye in a coffin
of lead, when yourselfe shall be wrapt in a winding-sheete: and indeed
the top of Powles conteins more names then <i>Stowes</i> Chronicle. These
lofty tricks being plaid, and you (thanks to your feete) being safely
ariued at the staires foote againe, your next worthy worke is, to
repaire to my lord <i>Chancellors Tomb</i> (and, if you can but reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
bestow some time vpon ye reading of Sir <i>Phillip Sydneyes</i> briefe
Epitaph; in the compasse of an houre you may make shift to stumble it
out. The great dyal is, your last monument: there bestow / some halfe
of the threescore minutes, to obserue the sawciness of the Jaikes that
are aboue the man in the moone there; the strangenesse of the motion
will quit your labour. Besides, you may heere haue fit occasion to
discouer your watch, by taking it forth, and setting the wheeles to
the time of Powles, which, I assure you, goes truer by fiue notes
then S. <i>Sepulchers</i> Chimes. The benefit that wil arise from hence is
this, that you publish your charge in maintaining a gilded clocke; and
withall the world shall know that you are a time-pleaser. By this I
imagine you haue walkt your belly ful, and thereupon being weary, or
(which rather I beleeue) being most Gentlemanlike hungry, it is fit
that I brought you into the Duke; so (because he followes the fashion
of great men, in keeping no house, and that therefore you must go seeke
your dinner) suffer me to take you by the hand, and lead you into an
Ordinary.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>




<p class="ph3"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></p>

<p class="center">How a yong Gallant should behaue himselfe in an Ordinary.</p>


<p>First, hauing diligently enquired out an Ordinary of the
largest reckoning, whither most of your Courtly Gallants do resort,
let it be your vse to repaire thither some halfe houre after eleuen;
for then you shàll find most of your fashionmongers planted in the
roome waiting for meate. Ride thither vpon your galloway-nag, or your
Spanish Jennet, a swift ambling pace, in your hose, and doublet (gilt
rapier and poniard bestowd in their places), and your French Lackey
carrying your cloake, and running before you; or rather in a coach, for
that will both hide you from the basiliske-eyes of your creditors, and
outrun a whole kennell of bitter-mouthed Sergeants.</p>

<p>Being arriued in the roome, salute not any but those of your
acquaintance: walke up and downe by the rest as scornfully and as
carelesly as a Gentleman-Usher: Select some friend (hauing first
throwne off your cloake) to walke vp and downe the room with you, let
him be suited if you can, worse by farre then your selfe, he will be a
foyle to you: and this will be a meanes to publish your clothes better
than Powles, a Tennis-court, or a Playhouse: discourse as lowd as you
can, no matter to what purpose if you but make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> a noise, and laugh in
fashion, and haue a good sower face to promise quarrelling, you shall
bee much obserued.</p>

<p>If you be a souldier, talke how often you haue beene in action: as
the <i>Portingale</i> voyage, Cales voiage, the <i>Iland</i> voiage, besides
some eight or nine imploiments in Ireland, and the low Countries:
then you may discourse how honourably your <i>Graue</i> vsed you; obserue
that you cal your <i>Graue Maurice</i>, your <i>Graue</i>: How often you haue
drunk with Count such a one, and such a Count, on your knees to your
<i>Graues</i> health: and let it bee your vertue to giue place neither
to <i>S. Kynock</i>, nor to any <i>Dutchman</i> whatsoeuer in the seuenteene
<i>prouinces</i>, for that Souldiers complement of drinking. And if you
perceiue that the vntrauelld company about you take this downe well,
ply them with more such stuffe, as how you haue interpreted betweene
the French King and a great Lord of Barbary, when they haue been
drinking healthes together, and that will be an excellent occasion to
publish your languages, if you haue them: if not, get some fragments
of French, or smal parcels of Italian, to fling about the table: but
beware how you speake any Latine there: your Ordinary most commonly
hath no more to do with Latine then a desperate towne of Garison hath.</p>

<p>If you be a Courtier, discourse of the obtaining of Suits: of your
mistresses fauours, etc. Make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> inquiry, if any gentleman at boord haue
any suit, to get which he would vse ye good means of a great mans
Interest with the King: and withall (if you haue not so much grace left
in you as to blush) that you are (thankes to your starres) in mightie
credit, though in your owne conscience you know, and are guilty to your
selfe, that you dare not (but onely vpon the priuiledges of hansome
clothes) presume to peepe into the presence. Demand if there be any
Gentleman (whom any there is acquainted with) that is troubled with two
offices; or any Vicar with two Church-liuings; which will politickly
insinuate, that your inquiry after them is because you haue good means
to obtaine them; yea and rather then your tongue should not be heard in
the roome, but that you should sit (like / an Asse) with your finger in
your mouth, and speake nothing: discourse how often this Lady hath sent
her Coach for you; and how often you have sweat in the Tennis-court
with that great Lord: for indeede the sweting together in <i>Fraunce</i>
(I mean the society of Tennis) is a great argument of most deere
affection, euen between noblemen and Pesants.</p>

<p>If you be a Poet, and come into the Ordinary (though it can be no
great glory to be an ordinary Poet) order yourselfe thus. Obserue no
man, doff not cap to that Gentleman to day at dinner, to whom, not two
nights since, you were beholden for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> a supper; but, after a turne or
two in the roome, take occasion (pulling out your gloues) to haue some
<i>Epigram</i>, or <i>Satyre</i>, or <i>Sonnet</i> fastned in one of them, that may
(as it were vomittingly to you) offer it selfe to the Gentlemen: they
will presently desire it: but, without much coniuration from them, and
a pretty kind of counterfet loathnes in yourselfe, do not read it;
and though it be none of your owne, sweare you made it. Mary, if you
chaunce to get into your hands any witty thing of another mans, that
is somewhat better, I would councell you then, if demand bee made who
composed it, you may say: faith, a learned Gentleman, a very worthy
friend. And this seeming to lay it on another man will be counted
either modestie in you, or a signe that you are not ambitious of
praise, or else that you dare not take it vpon you, for feare of the
sharpnesse it carries with it. Besides, it will adde much to your fame
to let your tongue walke faster then your teeth, though you be neuer
so hungry, and, rather then you should sit like a dumb Coxcomb, to
repeat by heart either some verses of your owne, or of any other mans,
stretching euen very good lines vpon the rack of the censure: though it
be against all law, honestie, or conscience, it may chaunce saue you
the price of your Ordinary, and beget you other <i>Suppliments</i>. Mary, I
would further intreat our Poet to be in league with the Mistresse of
the Ordinary, because from her (vpon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> condition that he will but ryme
knights and yong gentlemen to her house, and maintaine the table in
good fooling) he may easily make vp his mouth at her cost, <i>Gratis</i>.</p>

<p>Thus much for particular men. But in generall let all that are in
<i>Ordinary</i>-pay, march after the sound of these directions. Before /
the meate come smoaking to the board, our Gallant must draw out his
Tobacco-box, the ladell for the cold snuffe into the nosthrill, the
tongs and prining-Iron: All which artillery may be of gold or siluer
(if he can reach to the price of it), it will bee a reasonable vseful
pawne at all times, when the current of his money falles out to run
low. And heere you must obserue to know in what state Tobacco is in
towne, better then the Merchants, and to discourse of the Apottecaries
where it is to be sold and to be able to speake of their wines, as
readily as the Apottecary himselfe reading the barbarous hand of a
Doctor: then let him shew his seuerall tricks in taking it, As the
<i>Whiffe</i>, the <i>Ring</i>, etc. For these are complements that gaine
Gentlemen no mean respect and for which indeede they are more worthily
noted, I ensure you, then for any skill that they haue in learning.</p>

<p>When you are set downe to dinner, you must eate as impudently as can
be (for thats most Gentlemanlike) when your Knight is vpon his stewed
mutton, be presently, though you be but a capten, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> bosome of
your goose: and when your Justice of peace is knuckle-deep in goose,
you may, without disparagement to your bloud, though you haue a Lady to
your mother, fall very manfully to your woodcocks.</p>

<p>You may rise in dinner-time to aske for a close-stoole, protesting
to all the gentlemen that it costs you a hundred pounds a yeare in
physicke, besides the Annual pension which your wife allowes her
Doctor: and (if you please) you may (as your great French Lord doth)
inuite some speciall friend of yours, from the table, to hold discourse
with you as you sit in that withdrawing-chamber: from whence being
returned againe to the board, you shall sharpen the wits of all the
eating Gallants about you, and doe them great pleasure, to aske what
Pamphlets or poems a man might think fittest to wipe his taile with
(mary, this talke will be somewhat fowle if you carry not a strong
perfume about you) and, in propounding this question, you may abuse
the workes of any man; depraue his writings that you cannot equall,
and purchase to your selfe in time the terrible name of a seuere
<i>Criticke</i>; nay, and be one of the Colledge, if youle be liberall
inough: and (when your turne comes) pay for their suppers.</p>

<p>After / dinner, euery man as his busines leades him: some to dice, some
to drabs, some to playes, some to take vp friends in the Court, some to
take vp money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> in the Citty, some to lende testers in Powles, others
to borrow crownes vpon the Exchange: and thus, as the people is sayd
to bee a beast of many heads (yet all those heads like <i>Hydraes</i>) euer
growing, as various in their hornes as wondrous in their budding and
branching, so, in an Ordinary, you shall find the variety of a whole
kingdome in a few Apes of the kingdome.</p>

<p>You must not sweare in your dicing: for that Argues a violent
impatience to depart from your money, and in time will betray a mans
neede. Take heede of it. No! whether you be at <i>Primero</i>, or <i>Hazard</i>,
you shall sit as patiently (though you lose a whole halfe-yeares
exhibition) as a disarmd Gentleman does when hees in the vnmerciful
fingers of Serieants. Mary, I will allow you to sweat priuatly, and
teare six or seuen score paire of cards, be the damnation of some dozen
or twenty baile of dice, and forsweare play a thousand times in an
houre, but not sweare. Dice your selfe into your shirt: and, if you
haue a beard that your friend wil lend but an angell vpon, shaue it
off, and pawne that, rather then to goe home blinde to your lodging.
Further, it is to be remembred, He that is a great Gamester may be
trusted for a quarters board at all times, and apparell prouided, if
neede be.</p>

<p>At your tweluepenny Ordinary, you may giue any Iustice of peace, or
yong Knight (if he sit but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> degree towards the Equinoctiall of the
Saltseller) leaue to pay for the wine: and hee shall not refuse it,
though it be a weeke before the receiuing of his quarters rent, which
is a time albeit of good hope, yet of present necessity.</p>

<p>There is another Ordinary, to which your London Vsurer, your stale
Batchilor, and your thrifty Atturney do resort: the price three pence:
the roomes as full of company as a Iaile, and indeed diuided into
seuerall wards, like the beds of an Hospital. The complement betweene
these is not much, their words few: for the belly hath no eares: euery
mans eie heere is vpon the other mans trencher, to note whether his
fellow lurch him, or no: if they chaunce to discourse, it is of nothing
but of <i>Statutes</i>, <i>Bonds</i>, / <i>Recognizances</i>, <i>Fines</i>, <i>Recoueries</i>,
<i>Audits</i>, <i>Rents</i>, <i>Subsidies</i>, <i>Surties</i>, <i>Inclosures</i>, Liueries,
<i>Inditements</i>, <i>Outlaries</i>, <i>Feoffments</i>, <i>Iudgments</i>, <i>Commissions</i>,
<i>Bankerouts</i>, <i>Amercements</i>, and of such horrible matter, that when a
Lifetenant dines with his punck in the next roome, he thinkes verily
the men are coniuring. I can find nothing at this Ordinary worthy the
sitting downe for: therefore the cloth shall be taken away, and those
that are thought good enough to be guests heere, shall be too base
to bee waiters at your Grand Ordinary; at which your Gallant tastes
these commodities. He shall fare wel, enioy good company, receiue all
the newes ere the post can deliuer his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> packet, be perfect where the
best bawdy-houses stand, proclaime his good clothes, know this man to
drinke well, that to feed grosly, the other to swaggar roughly: he
shall, if hee be minded to trauell, put out money vpon his returne, and
haue hands enough to receiue it vpon any termes of repaiment: And no
question, if he be poore, he shall now and then light vpon some <i>Gull</i>
or other, whom he may skelder (after the gentile fashion) of mony: By
this time the parings of Fruit and Cheese are in the voyder, Cards and
dice lie stinking in the fire, the guests are all vp, the guilt rapiers
ready to be hangd, the French Lackquey, and Irish Footeboy, shrugging
at the doores, with their masters hobby-horses, to ride to the new
play: thats the <i>Randeuous</i>; thither they are gallopt in post. Let vs
take a paire of Oares, and now lustily after them.</p>

<p class="ph3"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></p>




<p class="center">How a Gallant should behaue himself in a Play-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> theater is your Poets Royal Exchange, vpon which their
Muses (that are now turnd to Merchants) meeting, barter away that
light commodity of words for a lighter ware then words, <i>Plaudites</i>,
and the <i>breath</i> of the great <i>Beast</i>; which (like the threatnings of
two Cowards) vanish all into air. <i>Plaiers</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> their <i>Factors</i>, who
put away the stuffe, and make the best of it they possibly can (as
indeed tis their parts so to doe), your / Gallant, your Courtier, and
your Capten, had wont to be the soundest paymaisters; and I thinke are
still the surest chapmen: and these, by meanes that their heades are
well stockt, deale vp&#333; this comical freight by the grosse: when your
<i>Groundling</i>, and <i>gallery-Commoner</i> buyes his sport by the penny, and,
like a <i>Hagler</i>, is glad to vtter it againe by retailing.</p>

<p>Sithence then the place is so free in entertainment, allowing a stoole
as well to the Farmers sonne as to your Templer: that your Stinkard has
the selfe-same libertie to be there in his Tobacco-Fumes, which your
sweet Courtier hath: and that your Car-man and Tinker claime as strong
a voice in their suffrage, and sit to giue iudgement on the plaies
life and death, as well as the prowdest <i>Momus</i> among the tribe[s] of
<i>Critick</i>: It is fit that hee, whom the most tailors bils do make roome
for, when he comes, should not be basely (like a vyoll) casd vp in a
corner.</p>

<p>Whether therefore the gatherers of the publique or priuate Play-house
stand to receiue the afternoones rent, let our Gallant (hauing paid it)
presently aduance himselfe vp to the Throne of the Stage. I meane not
into the Lords roome (which is now but the Stages Suburbs): No, those
boxes, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> iniquity of custome, conspiracy of waiting-women and
Gentlemen-Ushers, that there sweat together, and the couetousnes of
Sharers, are contemptibly thrust into the reare, and much new Satten
is there dambd, by being smothred to death in darknesse. But on the
very Rushes where the Commedy is to daunce, yea, and vnder the state
of <i>Cambises</i> himselfe must our fethered <i>Estridge</i>, like a piece of
Ordnance, be planted, valiantly (because impudently) beating downe the
mewes and hisses of the opposed rascality.</p>

<p>For do but cast vp a reckoning, what large cummings-in are pursd vp
by sitting on the Stage. First a conspicuous <i>Eminence</i> is gotten; by
which meanes, the best and most essenciall parts of a Gallant (good
cloathes, a proportionable legge, white hand, the Persian lock, and a
tollerable beard) are perfectly reuealed.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, you haue a signd patent to engrosse the whole
commodity of Censure; may lawfully presume to be a Girder; and stand
at the helme to steere the passage of <i>sc&oelig;nes</i>; yet / no man shall
once offer to hinder you from obtaining the title of an insolent,
ouer-weening Coxcombe.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, you may (without trauelling for it) at
the very next doore aske whose play it is: and, by that <i>Quest</i> of
<i>Inquiry</i>, the law warrants you to auoid much mistaking: if you know
not ye author, you may raile against him: and peraduenture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> so behaue
your selfe, that you may enforce the Author to know you.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, if you be a Knight, you may happily get you
a Mistresse: if a mere <i>Fleet-street</i> Gentleman, a wife: but assure
yourselfe, by continuall residence, you are the first and principall
man in election to begin the number of <i>We three</i>.</p>

<p>By spreading your body on the stage, and by being a Iustice in
examining of plaies, you shall put your selfe into such true
<i>sc&aelig;nical</i> authority, that some Poet shall not dare to present his
Muse rudely vpon your eyes, without hauing first vnmaskt her, rifled
her, and discouered all her bare and most mysticall parts before you at
a tauerne, when you most knightly shal, for his paines, pay for both
their suppers.</p>

<p>By sitting on the stage, you may (with small cost) purchase the deere
acquaintance of the boyes: haue a good stoole for sixpence: at any
time know what particular part any of the infants present: get your
match lighted, examine the play-suits lace, and perhaps win wagers
vpon laying tis copper, &amp;c. And to conclude, whether you be a foole or
a Justice of peace, a Cuckold, or a Capten, a Lord-Maiors sonne, or
a dawcocke, a knaue, or an vnder Sheriffe; of what stamp soeuer you
be, currant, or counterfet, the Stage, like time, will bring you to
most perfect light and lay you open: neither are you to be hunted from
thence, though the Scarcrows in the yard hoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> at you, hisse at you,
spit at you, yea, throw durt euen in your teeth: tis most Gentlemanlike
patience to endure all this, and to laugh at the silly Animals: but if
the <i>Rabble</i>, with a full throat, crie, away with the foole, you were
worse then a madman to tarry by it: for the Gentleman and the foole
should neuer sit on the Stage together.</p>

<p>Mary, let this obseruation go hand in hand with the rest: or rather,
like a country-seruing-man, some fiue yards before them. Present /
not your selfe on the Stage (especially at a new play) vntill the
quaking prologue hath (by rubbing) got culor into his cheekes, and is
ready to giue the trumpets their Cue, that hees vpon point to enter:
for then it is time, as though you were one of the <i>properties</i>, or
that you dropt out of ye <i>Hangings</i>, to creepe from behind the Arras,
with your <i>Tripos</i> or three-footed stoole in one hand, and a teston
mounted betweene a forefinger and a thumbe in the other: for if you
should bestow your person vpon the vulgar, when the belly of the house
is but halfe full, your apparell is quite eaten vp, the fashion lost,
and the proportion of your body in more danger to be deuoured then if
it were serued vp in the Counter amongst the Powltry: auoid that as
you would the Bastome. It shall crowne you with rich commendation to
laugh alowd in the middest of the most serious and saddest scene of
the terriblest Tragedy: and to let that clapper (your tongue) be tost
so high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> that all the house may ring of it: your Lords vse it; your
Knights are Apes to the Lords, and do so too: your Inne-a-court-man is
Zany to the Knights, and (mary very scuruily) comes likewise limping
after it: bee thou a beagle to them all, and neuer lin snuffing, till
you haue scented them: for by talking and laughing (like a Plough-man
in a Morris) you heap <i>Pelion</i> vpon <i>Ossa</i>, glory vpon glory: As first,
all the eyes in the galleries will leaue walking after the Players,
and onely follow you: the simplest dolt in the house snatches vp your
name, and when he meetes you in the streetes, or that you fall into his
hands in the middle of a Watch, his word shall be taken for you: heele
cry <i>Hees such a gallant</i>, and you passe. Secondly, you publish your
temperance to the world, in that you seeme not to resort thither to
taste vaine pleasures with a hungrie appetite: but onely as a Gentleman
to spend a foolish houre or two, because yoe can doe nothing else:
Thirdly, you mightily disrelish the Audience, and disgrace the Author:
marry, you take vp (though it be at the worst hand) a strong opinion
of your owne iudgement, and inforce the Poet to take pity of your
weakenesse, and, by some dedicated sonnet, to bring you into a better
paradice, onely to stop your mouth.</p>

<p>If you can (either for loue or money) prouide your selfe a lodging
by the water-side: for, aboue the conuenience it brings to / shun
Shoulder-clapping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> and to ship away your Cockatrice betimes in the
morning, it addes a kind of state vnto you, to be carried from thence
to the staires of your Playhouse: hate a Sculler (remember that) worse
then to be acquainted with one o' th' Scullery. No, your Oares are your
onely Sea-crabs, boord them, and take heed you neuer go twice together
with one paire: often shifting is a great credit to Gentlemen; and that
diuiding of your fare wil make the poore watersnaks be ready to pul
you in peeces to enioy your custome: No matter whether vpon landing,
you haue money or no: you may swim in twentie of their boates ouer
the riuer upon <i>Ticket</i>: mary, when siluer comes in, remember to pay
trebble their fare, and it will make your Flounder-catchers to send
more thankes after you, when you doe not draw, then when you doe; for
they know, It will be their owne another daie.</p>

<p>Before the Play begins, fall to cardes: you may win or loose (as
<i>Fencers</i> doe in a prize) and beate one another by confederacie, yet
share the money when you meete at supper: notwithstanding, to gul
the <i>Ragga-muffins</i> that stand aloofe gaping at you, throw the cards
(hauing first torne foure or fiue of them) round about the Stage, iust
vpon the third sound, as though you had lost: it skils not if the foure
knaues ly on their backs, and outface the Audience; theres none such
fooles as dare take exceptions at them, because, ere the play go off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
better knaues than they will fall into the company.</p>

<p>Now sir, if the writer be a fellow that hath either epigrammd you, or
hath had a flirt at your mistris, or hath brought either your feather,
or your red beard, or your little legs, &amp;c. on the stage, you shall
disgrace him worse then by tossing him in a blancket, or giuing him the
bastinado in a Tauerne, if, in the middle of his play (bee it Pastoral
or Comedy, Morall or Tragedie), you rise with a screwd and discontented
face from your stoole to be gone: no matter whether the Scenes be
good or no; the better they are the worse do you distast them: and,
beeing on your feet, sneake not away like a coward, but salute all your
gentle acquaintance, that are spred either on the rushes, or on stooles
about you, and draw what troope you can from the stage after you: the
<i>Mimicks</i> are beholden to you, for allowing them / elbow roome: their
Poet cries, perhaps, a pox go with you, but care not for that, theres
no musick without frets.</p>

<p>Mary, if either the company, or indisposition of the weather binde you
to sit it out, my counsell is then that you turne plain Ape, take vp
a rush, and tickle the earnest eares of your fellow gallants, to make
other fooles fall a laughing: mewe at passionate speeches, blare at
merrie, finde fault with the musicke, whew at the childrens Action,
whistle at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> songs: and aboue all, curse the sharers, that whereas
the same day you had bestowed forty shillings on an embrodered Felt and
Feather (scotch-fashion) for your mistres in the Court, or your punck
in the city, within two houres after, you encounter with the very same
block on the stage, when the haberdasher swore to you the impression
was extant but that morning.</p>

<p>To conclude, hoard vp the finest play-scraps you can get, vpon which
your leane wit may most sauourly feede, for want of other stuffe, when
the <i>Arcadian</i> and <i>Euphuizd</i> gentlewomen haue their tongues sharpened
to set vpon you: that qualitie (next to your shittlecocke) is the onely
furniture to a Courtier thats but a new beginner, and is but in his A
B C of complement. The next places that are fild, after the Playhouses
bee emptied, are (or ought to be) Tauernes: into a Tauerne then let vs
next march, where the braines of one Hogshead must be beaten out to
make vp another.</p>

<p class="ph3"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></p>



<p class="center">How a Gallant should behaue himself in a Tauerne.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Whosoeuer</span> desires to bee a man of good reckoning in the
Cittie, and (like your French Lord) to haue as many tables furnisht as
Lackies (who, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> keepe least, keepe none), whether he be a yong
<i>Quat</i> of the first yeeres reuennew, or some austere and sullen-facd
steward, who (in despight of a great beard, a satten suite, and a
chaine of gold wrapt in cipers) proclaimes himselfe to any (but to
those to whom his Lord owes money) for a ranck coxcombe, or whether
he be a country gentleman, that brings his / wife vp to learne the
fashion, see the Tombs at Westminster, the Lyons in the Tower, or to
take physicke; or else is some yong Farmer, who many times makes his
wife (in the country) beleeue he hath suits in law, because he will
come vp to his letchery: be he of what stamp he will that hath money in
his purse, and a good conscience to spend it, my councell is that hee
take his continuall diet at a Tauerne, which (out of question) is the
onely <i>Rende-vous</i> of boone company; and the Drawers the most nimble,
the most bold, and most sudden proclaimers of your largest bounty.</p>

<p>Hauing therefore thrust your selfe into a case most in fashion (how
coarse soeuer the stuffe be, tis no matter so it hold fashion), your
office is (if you meane to do your iudgment right) to enquire out
those Tauernes which are best customd, whose maisters are oftenest
drunk (for that confirmes their taste, and that they choose wholesome
wines), and such as stand furthest from ye counters; where, landing
yourself and your followers, your first com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>plement shall be to grow
most inwardly acquainted with the drawers, to learne their names, as
<i>Iack</i>, and <i>Will</i>, and <i>Tom</i>, to diue into their inclinations, as
whether this fellow vseth to the Fencing Schoole, this to the Dauncing
Schoole; whether that yong coniurer (in Hogsheads) at midnight keepes
a Gelding now and then to visit his Cockatrice, or whether he loue
dogs, or be addicted to any other eminent and Citizen-like quality: and
protest your selfe to be extreamely in loue, and that you spend much
money in a yeare, vpon any one of those exercises which you perceiue
is followed by them. The vse which you shall make of this familiarity
is this: If you want money fiue or six daies together, you may still
pay the reckoning with this most Gentlemanlike language, <i>Boy, fetch
me money from the barre</i>, and keepe yourself most prouidently from a
hungry melancholy in your chamber. Besides, you shal be sure (if there
be but one fawcet that can betray neate wine to the barre) to haue that
arraignd before you, sooner then a better and worthier person.</p>

<p>The first question you are to make (after the discharging of your
pocket of Tobacco and pipes, and the houshold stuffe thereto belonging)
shall be for an inuentorie of the Kitchen: for it were / more then
most Tailor-like, and to be suspected you were in league with some
Kitchen-wench, to descend your selfe, to offend your stomach with the
sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> Larder, and happily to grease your Accoustrements. Hauing
therefore receiued this bill, you shall (like a capten putting vp deere
paies) haue many Sallads stand on your table, as it were for blankes
to the other more seruiceable dishes: and according to the time of the
yeare, vary your fare, as Capon is a stirring meate sometime, Oysters
are a swelling meate sometimes, Trowt a tickling meate sometimes,
greene Goose, and Woodcock, a delicate meate sometimes, especially in
a Tauerne, where you shall sit in as great state as a Church-warden
amongst his poore Parishioners, at <i>Pentecost</i> or <i>Christmas</i>.</p>

<p>For your drinke, let not your Physitian confine you to any one
particular liquor: for as it is requisite that a Gentleman should not
alwaies be plodding in one Art, but rather bee a generall Scholler
(that is, to haue a licke at all sorts of learning, and away) so tis
not fitting a man should trouble his head with sucking at one Grape,
but that he may be able (now there is a generall peace) to drink any
stranger drunke in his owne element of drinke, or more properly in his
owne mist language.</p>

<p>Your discourse at the table must be such as that which you vtter at
your Ordinary: your behauiour the same, but somewhat more carelesse:
for where your expence is great, let your modesty be lesse: and, though
you should be mad in a Tauerne, the largenesse of the <i>Items</i> will
beare with your inciuility:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> you may, without prick to your conscience,
set the want of your wit against the superfluity and saucines of their
reckonings.</p>

<p>If you desire not to be haunted with <i>Fidlers</i> (who by the statute haue
as much libertie as <i>Roagues</i> to trauell into any place, hauing the
pasport of the house about them) bring then no women along with you:
but if you loue the company of all the drawers, neuer sup without your
Cockatrice: for, hauing her there, you shall be sure of most officious
attendance. Enquire what Gallants sup in the next roome, and if they be
any of your acquaintance, do not you (after the City fashion) send them
in a pottle of wine, and your name, sweetned in two pittiful papers of
Suger, with some filthy Apology cramd into the mouth of / a drawer; but
rather keepe a boy in fee, who vnderhand shall proclaime you in euery
roome, what a gallant fellow you are, how much you spend yearely in
Tauernes, what a great gamester, what custome you bring to the house,
in what witty discourse you maintaine a table, what Gentlewomen or
Cittizens wiues you can with a wet finger haue at any time to sup with
you, and such like. By which <i>Encomiasticks</i> of his, they that know you
shall admire you, and thinke themselues to bee brought into a paradice
but to be meanely in your acquaintance; and if any of your endeered
friends be in the house, and beate the same Iuybush that your selfe
does, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> may ioyne companies, and bee drunke together most publikly.</p>

<p>But in such a deluge of drinke, take heede that no man counterfeit
him selfe drunck, to free his purse from the danger of the shot: tis
a usuall thing now amongst gentlemen; it had wont bee the quality of
Cocknies: I would aduise you to leaue so much braines in your head as
to preuent this. When the terrible Reckoning (like an inditement) bids
you hold vp your hand, and that you must answere it at the barre, you
must not abate one penny in any particular, no, though they reckon
cheese to you, when you haue neither eaten any, nor could euer abide
it, raw or toasted: but cast your eie onely vpon the <i>Totalis</i>, and no
further; for to trauerse the bill would betray you to be acquainted
with the rates of the market, nay more, it would make the Vintners
beleeue you were <i>Pater familias</i>, and kept a house; which, I assure
you, is not now in fashion.</p>

<p>If you fall to dice after Supper, let the drawers be as familiar
with you as your Barber, and venture their siluer amongst you; no
matter where they had it: you are to cherish the vnthriftinesse of
such yong tame pigions, if you be a right gentleman: for when two are
yoakt together by the purse strings, and draw the <i>Chariot</i> of Madam
<i>Prodigalitie</i>, when one faints in the way and slips his hornes, let
the other reioice and laugh at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>At your departure forth the house, to kiss mine Hostis ouer the barre,
or to accept of the courtesie of the Celler when tis offered you by the
drawers, and you must know that kindnes neuer creepes vpon them, but
when they see you almost cleft to the shoulders, or to bid any of the
Vintners good night, is as commendable, as for a Barber after trimming
to laue your face with sweete water.</p>

<p>To conclude, count it an honour, either to inuite or be inuited to
any Rifling: for commonly, though you finde much satten there, yet
you shall likewise finde many cittizens sonnes, and heirs, and yonger
brothers there, who smell out such feasts more greedily then taylors
h&#363;t upon sundaies after weddings. And let any hooke draw you either
to a Fencers supper, or to a Players that acts such a part for a wager;
for by this meanes you shall get experience, by beeing guilty to their
abhominable shauing.</p>

<p class="center">How a Gallant is to behaue himselfe passing through the Cittie, at all
houres of the night, and how to passe by any watch.</p>


<p>After the sound of pottle-pots is out of your eares, and that
the spirit of Wine and Tobacco walkes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> your braine, the Tauerne door
being shut vppon your backe, cast about to passe through the widest
and goodliest streetes in the Cittie. And if your meanes cannot reach
to the keeping of a boy, hire one of the drawers, to be as a lanthorne
vnto your feete, and to light you home: and, still as you approch neere
any night-walker that is vp as late as yourselfe curse and swear (like
one that speaks hie dutch) in a lofty voice, because your men haue
vsd you so like a rascoll in not waiting vpon you, and vow the next
morning to pull their blew cases ouer their eares, though, if your
chamber were well searcht, you giue onely six pence a weeke to some old
woman to make your bed, and that she is all the seruing-creatures you
giue wages to. If you smell a watch (and that you may easily doe, for
commonly they eate onions to keep them in sleeping, which they account
a medicine against cold) or, if you come within danger of their browne
bils, let him that is your candlestick, and holds vp your torch from
dropping (for to march after a linck is shoomaker-like), let <i>Ignis
Fatuus</i>, I say, being within the reach of the Constables staffe, aske
aloud, <i>Sir Giles</i>, or <i>Sir Abram</i>, will you turne this way, or downe
that streete? It skils not, though there be none dubd in your Bunch;
the watch will winke at you, onely for the loue they beare to armes
and knighthood: mary, if the Centinell and his court of Guard stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
strictly vpon his martiall Law and cry stand, c&#333;manding you to giue
the word, and to shew reason why your Ghost walkes so late, doe it in
some Jest (for that will shew you haue a desperate wit, and perhaps
make him and his halberdiers afraid to lay fowle hands vpon you) or,
if you read a mittimus in the Constables booke, counterfeit to be a
Frenchman, a Dutchman, or any other nation whose country is in peace
with your owne; and you may passe the pikes: for beeing not able to
vnderstand you, they cannot by the customes of the Citie take your
examination, and so by consequence they haue nothing to say to you.</p>

<p>If the night be old, and that your lodging be some place into which
no Artillery of words can make a breach, retire, and rather assault
the dores of your punck, or (not to speak broken English) your sweete
mistris, vpon whose white bosome you may languishingly consume the
rest of darknesse that is left, in rauishing (though not restoratiue)
pleasures, without expenses, onely by vertue of foure or fiue oathes
(when the siege breakes vp, and at your marching away with bag and
baggage) that the last night you were at dice, and lost so much
in gold, so much in siluer; and seeme to vex most that two such
<i>Elizabeth</i> twenty-shilling peeces, or foure such spur-ryals (sent
you with a cheese and a bakt meate from your mother) rid away amongst
the rest. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> which tragicall yet pollitick speech, you may not only
haue your nighte worke done <i>Gratis</i>, but also you may take dyet there
the next day, and depart with credit, onely upon the bare word of a
Gentleman to make her restitution.</p>

<p>All the way as you passe (especially being approcht neere some of the
Gates) talk of none but Lords, and such Ladies with whom you haue plaid
at <i>Primero</i>, or daunced in the Presence the very same day. It is a
chaunce to lock vp the lippes of an inquisitiue Bel-man: and being
arriued at your lodging doore, which I would councell you to choose in
some rich Cittizens house, salute at parting no man but by the name of
Sir (as though you had supt with Knights) albeit you had none in your
company but your <i>Perinado</i>, or your <i>Inghle</i>.</p>

<p>Happily it will be blowne abroad, that you and your Shoale of Gallants
swum through such an Ocean of wine, that you danced so much money out
at heeles, and that in wild-foule there flew away thus much: and I
assure you, to haue the bill of your reckoning lost of purpose, so
that it may be publisht, will make you to be held in deere estimation:
onely the danger is, if you owe money, and that your reuealing gets
your Creditors by the eares; for then looke to haue a peal of ordinance
thundring at your chamber doore the next morning. But if either your
Tailor, Mercer, Haberdasher, Silkeman, Cutter, Linen Draper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> or
Sempster, stand like a guard of <i>Switzers</i> about your lodging, watching
your vprising, or, if they misse of that, your down lying in one of the
Counters, you haue no meanes to auoid the galling of their small-shot,
then by sending out a light-horseman to call your Apotecary to your
aide, who, encountring this desperate band of your Creditors, onely
with two or three glasses in his hand, as though that day you purgd,
is able to driue them all to their holes like so many Foxes: for the
name of taking physicke is a sufficient <i>Quietus est</i> to any endangered
Gentleman, and giues an acquittance (for the time) to them all, though
the twelue Companies stand with their hoods to attend your comming
forth and their Officers with them.</p>

<p>I could now fetch you about noone (the houre which I prescribed you
before to rise at) out of your chamber, and carry you with mee into
<i>Paules Church-yard</i>; where planting your selfe in a Stationers shop,
many instructions are to bee giuen you, what bookes to call for, how
to censure of new bookes, how to mew at the old, how to looke in your
tables and inquire for such and such <i>Greeke</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>Italian</i>, or
<i>Spanish</i> Authors, whose names you haue there, but whom your mother
for pitty would not giue you so much wit as to vnderstand. From thence
you should blow your selfe into the Tobacco-Ordinary, where you are
likewise to spend your iudgment (like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> <i>Quack-saluer</i>) vpon that
mysticall wonder, to bee able to discourse whether your <i>Cane</i> or your
Pudding be sweetest, and which pipe has the best boare, and which
burnes black, which breakes in the burning, &amp;c. Or, if you itch to step
into the Barbers, a whole <i>Dictionary</i> cannot afford more words to
set downe notes what <i>Dialogues</i> you are to maintaine whilest you are
Doctor of the Chaire there. After your shauing, I could breath you in a
<i>Fence-schoole</i>, and out of that cudgell you into a <i>Dauncing schoole</i>,
in both which I could weary you, by shewing you more tricks then are
in fiue galleries, or fifteen prizes. And, to close vp the stomach
of this feast, I could make Cockneies, whose fathers haue left them
well, acknowledge themselues infinitely beholden to me, for teaching
them by familiar demonstration how to spend their patrimony and to get
themselues names, when their fathers are dead and rotten. But lest too
many dishes should cast into a surfet, I will now take away; yet so
that, if I perceiue you relish this well, the rest shall be (in time)
prepared for you. <i>Fare-well.</i></p>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_2">2</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Rubie.</i>&mdash;This is the famous and characteristic note of
Euphuism&mdash;the accumulation of similes from natural history, or what
was taken for natural history. It can hardly be necessary to take note
of each of these; still less of the abundant classical allusions which
any one acquainted with the classics will understand at once, and which
could only be explained to others by loading these notes with lumps of
Lemprière. Nor will any one find much difficulty in the language if
he remembers that 'then' and 'than,' 'there' and 'their,' 'wayed' and
'weighed,' were written, or at least printed, in those days according
to the liberal standard of the taste and fancy of the speller. In case
of any difficulty, reading the word aloud will generally solve it. In a
few instances, however, it may be well to gloss a little more specially.</p>

<p><i>M.</i>&mdash;I am not sure what this abbreviates. 'Master,' for which it is
the commonest sign, would do.</p>

<p><i>Oftscome</i> = 'off-scum,' 'off-scouring.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_3">3</a>.</p>

<p><i>Find faulte</i> is rather a loss: it is better than 'fault-finder.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Closset.</i>&mdash;This refers to the famous copy of Homer called &#7969; &#7953;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#957;&#7937;&#961;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#959;&#962;,
which Alexander carried about with him in a sumptuous
<i>narthex</i>&mdash;a portable medicine-case.</p>

<p><i>Bourde</i> = 'jest.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>.</p>

<p><i>Parson</i> and 'person,' interchangeably.</p>

<p><i>Cirpo</i>, rather <i>scirpo</i>.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>.</p>

<p><i>Denocated.</i>&mdash;A mistake for either 'denotated' or 'devocated,' both
possible and easily intelligible words.</p>

<p><i>Werish</i> = 'wersh,' 'weak,' 'sickly.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>.</p>

<p><i>Predictam</i> of course should be <i>praeditam</i>.</p>

<p><i>Presisnes</i>, for 'preciseness,' is a good example of the quaint tricks
played by phonetics.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.</p>

<p><i>Gale</i> = gall = (in next line) <i>fel</i>.</p>

<p><i>Player.</i>&mdash;Before his 'conversion' Gosson had himself had much to do
with the theatre.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_11">11</a>.</p>

<p><i>Plotinus.</i>&mdash;Either Lodge or his printer has made nonsense of this. For
'Plotinus' read 'Plautus.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>.</p>

<p><i>Saphier.</i>&mdash;Evident misprint for 'Sapphic.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>.</p>

<p>The quotation has been set right in some obvious matters, though not
materially altered. In the second line of the English version 'with'
should no doubt be 'which,' 'wh.' being the abbreviation for both.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>.</p>

<p>Tyrtæus may perhaps be hid to some under his disguise of <i>Tirtheus</i>,
which on p. 20 becomes <i>Tirthetus</i>.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Quinque</i> for <i>quique</i> is very funny.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Stare</i> = 'star,' 'mole.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>.</p>

<p><i>Acuate</i> = 'sharpened,' 'spurred on.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Lodge is much more eloquent and much more urgent
in defence of music than of poetry, and indeed the <i>melomania</i> of the
Elizabethans is well known.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>.</p>

<p><i>Buggs</i> = 'bugbears.'</p>

<p><i>Pavions</i> = 'pavone' or 'pavine,' the well-known stately
'peacock-dance' of the time.</p>

<p><i>Dump.</i>&mdash;Not merely as now used, 'a fit of melancholy,' but 'a
melancholy tune,' and even a dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>.</p>

<p><i>Your (Gosson) for exempting.</i>&mdash;'Your' may be mere carelessness for
'you,' or Lodge may have at one time meant to write, 'your exempting
yourself.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>.</p>

<p>Last line of quotation of course <i>contemnas</i> and <i>nam</i>.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>.</p>

<p>Probably the printer gave <i>Silius Italicus</i> his <i>v</i>.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>.</p>

<p><i>Pappe with an hatchet</i> has been much discussed. The sense, which is
not unlike 'giving him his gruel,' is clear enough, and any number of
explanations of the form occur.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> Cf. Shylock's 'The <i>patch</i> is kindly.'</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>.</p>

<p><i>Huffe, Ruffe, and Snuffe.</i>&mdash;Characters in Preston's <i>Cambyses</i>. It
cannot be necessary to annotate each of the plays on words of which
"grating" for "greeting" is the first, and which occur throughout.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>.</p>

<p><i>Ale dagger</i>, may refer to the custom of drinking with swords on the
table.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.</p>

<p><i>Scaddle</i> is unannotated by Mr. Maskell, and does not appear in other
dictionaries, even in that of Professor Skeat. But that excellent
scholar, with his usual kindness, has given me a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> on it. It is the
A.S. <i>scadol</i> from 'scathe,' and means 'mischievous,' with a secondary
sense of 'thievish,' and a tertiary one of 'timid' or 'skulking.' It is
here probably used in a combination of all these.</p>

<p><i>Dydoppers</i> = 'didappers,' 'dabchicks.'</p>


<p>P. 51.</p>

<p><i>Bastard</i> senior and junior are polite references to <i>Martin</i> senior
and <i>Martin</i> junior, two of the pseudonyms set to the Marprelate
pamphlets.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>.</p>

<p><i>Elderton.</i>&mdash;A theatrical manager.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>.</p>

<p><i>Three a vies.</i>&mdash;A 'vie' is a single stake or game at cards, or
anything else. 'Three a vies' therefore equals our 'best of three.'
'Passage,' a game with dice. 'Stabbing' was a form of cogging.
'Cater-tray,' four and three. 'Cater-caps,' trencher-caps.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>.</p>

<p><i>Dicker of leather.</i>&mdash;A bundle of ten skins.</p>

<p><i>Woodsere.</i>&mdash;Probably, as Mr. Maskell suggests, the sap that sputters
from green faggots.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>.</p>

Martinists.</p>

quite lost.</p>

<p><i>Muzroule</i> or musroule.&mdash;A nose-band.</p>

<p><i>Port mouth.</i>&mdash;I presume a kind of twitch.</p>

<p><i>Mubble fubbles</i> = 'dumps,' 'blues.'</p>

<p><i>Celarent</i> and <i>ferio</i>.&mdash;This play on the <i>memoria technica</i> of logical
mood and figure is ingenious.</p>

tune.</p>

<p>Title. <i>Wit and Will</i> is the first of the 'five discourses.' Below, in
the second motto, 'Vir<i>e</i>s' should of course be 'vir<i>u</i>s,' being no
doubt a mere misprint.</p>


<p>P. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>.</p>

<p><i>Labra</i>, copies <i>labe</i>; either a mere misprint or a blunder for <i>labea</i>
